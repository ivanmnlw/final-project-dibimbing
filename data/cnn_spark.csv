However, after just a few weeks of talks, negotiations appeared to stall.During the discussions, various options were considered regarding the structure of the business integration, according to the statement.Honda proposed changing the structure of the intended merger from a joint holding company, as agreed initially, to a deal with Honda as the parent company and Nissan its subsidiary through a share exchange. Both companies concluded eventually that it was best to “cease discussions,” the statement added.Nissan has struggled since the collapse of its long-standing alliance with French carmaker Renault. It faces severe financial problems that put it in desperate need of a larger partner. Some analysts had speculated Nissan could face bankruptcy as soon as 2026 when it has a huge amount of debt coming due.Nissan’s profits in the six months ending in September plunged 94% compared with the same period in 2023, as the company lost money on auto operations and reported only a narrow profit due to its financing business. In response, Nissan announced it would cut its manufacturing output by 20%, laying off 9,000 workers as a result. It also slashed its forecast for full-year operating profit by 70%.Intense competitionBeyond its financial problems, Nissan – like most legacy automakers – faces huge research and development costs in the transition from making gasoline- to electric-powered vehicles required to comply with tougher environmental regulations around the world.Nissan is headquartered in Yokohama, Japan. Akio Kon/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe company has had some success with its EV offerings, such as the Nissan Leaf, an asset it brought to the table in merger discussions.EV development costs have created a powerful incentive for carmakers to explore mergers as a way to share the financial burden, according to analysts.“Nissan is in a tricky position following the collapse of its $60 billion merger talks with Honda. The Japanese automaker will be looking for a new firm to partner with,” Lucinda Guthrie, head of Mergermarket, said on Wednesday.“As technology advances players may need to consider more steps towards manufacturing ‘robots on wheels’ rather than combustion engine vehicles, it could well be the case that Big Tech companies and electronic components manufacturers, such as Foxconn, become crucial partners,” she added.The Taiwanese maker of electronics, best known for being Apple’s main supplier, has confirmed it is interested in speaking with Nissan about working together, its chairman, Young Liu, told reporters on Wednesday. Foxconn is not interested in acquiring the carmaker, he added.Since 1999, Nissan has been in an alliance with Renault. The two agreed in January 2023 to restructure their partnership, with the French company whittling down its stake in the Japanese carmaker to 15%, a significant milestone in their long collaboration.The carmakers had worked in tandem, alongside junior partner Mitsubishi Motors. The alliance had allowed them to share production and technology and ultimately save billions of dollars a year. But the grouping fell apart after the stunning downfall of its former chief Carlos Ghosn in 2018.This story has been updated with additional information and context.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9967181086540222
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/13/economy/elon-musk-cfpb-elizabeth-warren-trump/index.html,2025-02-13 17:30:00,CFPB: Elizabeth Warren has grave concerns about Elon Musk gutting her consumer watchdog,"New York About a year before the subprime mortgage meltdown brought the global financial system to its knees, a Harvard Law School professor made the case for launching a new regulator to protect consumers getting ripped off by mortgages, car loans and other financial products.After the Great Financial Crisis, that professor — now-Sen. Elizabeth Warren — got her wish. In 2010, Congress voted in favor of a sweeping financial overhaul that created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The new watchdog, reviled by the banking industry, would go on to return nearly $20 billion to consumers allegedly harmed by everything from fake bank accounts (see: Wells Fargo), illegal foreclosures and improper car repossessions.Now, Warren is alarmed as the regulator she helped create has been virtually paralyzed by the Trump administration, in an effort led by the world’s richest man.Days after billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom Trump named head of the Department of Government Efficiency, posted “RIP CFPB” with a tombstone emoji on social media, the CFPB’s Washington headquarters were shut down. Employees were ordered to “stand down” from all work — even protecting consumers from financial abuse.“Elon Musk is trying an end-run around Congress to try to sideline the cops on the beat so that he and a handful of billionaires can do whatever they want,” Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, told CNN in a phone interview this week.‘Utterly outrageous’The CFPB terminated the contracts of multiple expert witnesses in recent days, CNN has learned, suggesting the watchdog no longer plans to pursue enforcement cases against at least some financial institutions accused of hurting consumers.“The richest man in the world is coming in to shut down a case where a lender is cheating working people,” one expert witness whose contract was canceled on Tuesday told CNN in a phone interview, alluding to Elon Musk. “It’s utterly outrageous.”The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.Some in the business community argue the CFPB has gone too far in its quest to root out financial crime.The White House said this week that the CFPB has become a “weaponized” arm of the government, one that has been unleashed to target “certain industries and individuals disfavored by so-called ‘elites.’”President Donald Trump confirmed to reporters on Monday that his goal is to eliminate the CFPB as part of his quest to “get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.”Baltimore’s mayor and city council filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the CFPB and its acting director, Russell Vought, that asked a federal court to halt the funding and operations freeze.The sidelining of the CFPB is an attempt to “do by fiat what opponents of the CFPB were unable to do in Congress or the courts,” the lawsuit alleged.The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.‘It’s damn popular’Warren noted that Republicans have control of the White House and a majority in both chambers of Congress.“Congress created the CFPB. Congress, and only Congress, has the power to end it. If they thought they could get enough votes, they could go get rid of the CFPB right now,” Warren said. “So why don’t the Republicans do that? The answer is because it’s damn popular.”Warren argued that this is a bipartisan issue because Democrats, Republicans and independents all don’t like “getting cheated” on their mortgages, credit cards, payday loans or student loans.Musk, by contrast, has argued that the CFPB is duplicative and should be eliminated to ease costly regulatory burdens on business.People attend a protest in support of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on February 10. Jacquelyn Martin/APConflict of interest concernsOf course, Musk’s business empire stands to gain from his efforts to cut red tape.In particular, a Tesla subsidiary provides auto loans — an area normally policed by the CFPB.Not only that, but Musk hopes to turn X, formerly known as Twitter, into an everything app that will eventually let users send each other money.Yet Musk is presiding over the effort to gut the primary federal financial regulator overseeing payments.During a question-and-answer session in the Oval Office on Tuesday night, Musk pushed back against concerns about conflicts of interest.“All of our actions are fully public,” Musk said. “So if you see anything like, ‘Elon, there may be a conflict there,’ it’s not like people are going to be shy about it. They are going to say it immediately.”Since Musk is serving as an unpaid special government employee, he will not need to file a public financial disclosure, the White House said.“As an unpaid special government employee who is not a commission officer, he will file a confidential financial disclosure report per the norm,” a White House official told CNN’s Alayna Treene.‘Slippery slope’Warren argued that Musk is taking advantage of a loophole in ethics law.“The presumption was that this option would only be used by people who are temporary and have very little authority. That is clearly not Elon Musk,” Warren said. “Elon Musk is operating as co-president of the United States. Elon Musk may try to hide his conflicts, but there are enough conflicts right out there in full view of the public to tell us he should not be allowed to make any decisions about the direction of this government.”Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who was the chief ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, told CNN that a judge should rule that Musk’s financial disclosure must be made public because he is already performing the work of someone who is a Senate-confirmed officer.“This is a big problem,” said Painter.Ann Skeet, senior director of leadership ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, said the tone was set early on by Trump for opting not to follow conflict-of-interest norms set by previous presidents.“Once the president says the rules don’t apply to himself,” Skeet said, “it creates the slippery slope we are now on.”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9977583885192871

Did they vote for this?,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.President Donald Trump has hit his second term at a full sprint, marking each day with a flurry of activity meant to rebrand the country and remake the government.It’s been a dizzying onslaught of activity that may have people’s heads spinning. Did all of the people who voted for Trump really want all of this?On Thursday, it was a promise to impose new tariffs on foreign automobiles despite a spike in inflation data. Inflation and the economy, if you read the polling data, were two of the main drivers behind Trump’s election win. Tariffs, if you believe most economists, are going to make things more expensive, not less.Trump’s campaign promises to impose tariffs and to bring down prices were contradictory, and he has decided to focus on tariffs over inflation, at least to start.He has also used his power to make changes that were never mentioned on the campaign trail, like renaming the “Gulf of Mexico” to the “Gulf of America.” Most Americans, 71%, oppose the name change, according to a recent Marquette University poll.Add together Trump’s many large policy goals — mass deportation, a much smaller bureaucracy, a why-bother attitude toward climate change — and he could leave behind a much different country than the one he took over from President Joe Biden.And that’s the point of elections, as Trump has argued, including Tuesday in the Oval Office when he said that voters chose his plan to drastically cut down on government spending.“That’s what I got elected for, that and borders and military, and a lot of things. But this is a big part of it.”Elon Musk is seen in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, February 11, 2025. Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesOr, as Trump’s chief government cost cutter Elon Musk said, “The people voted for major government reform. There should be no doubt about that. That was on the campaign.”Musk is certainly right that Trump promised drastic change, particularly on immigration, slashing the size of government, ending birthright citizenship and more.The details, particularly on slashing the size of government, may be coming as a surprise to some. Trump did not talk much on the campaign trail about ending agencies such as USAID and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He actively distanced himself from Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has turned out to be very similar to much of Trump’s second-term agenda.Dissatisfaction with Trump on inflationInflation was among voters’ biggest gripes with the Biden administration. And yet Trump’s early moves, particularly on tariffs, may drive up prices, at least in the short term.“There’s a lot of things that folks have liked about Donald Trump’s first few weeks in office. Inflation is not one of them,” CNN Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten said during an appearance on the network. Enten pointed to a recent CBS poll in which 66% of Americans said he wasn’t focusing enough on lowering the prices of goods and services. That includes nearly half of Republicans.Video Ad Feedback Trump says he doesn't know why Musk met with India's PM 04:13 - Source: CNN Trump says he doesn't know why Musk met with India's PM 04:13General approval of TrumpIn the same CBS poll, however, Trump has a positive approval rating, 53%, and majorities described him as tough, energetic, focused and effective. Other polls have shown him slightly underwater.Most people in the CBS poll, 70%, also agreed that he’s doing what he promised to do.A majority may approve of him and a strong majority may have expected all of this, but that doesn’t mean most people agree with all of it.Americans can be just as contradictory as TrumpUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents walk down a street during a multi-agency targeted enforcement operation in Chicago, Illinois, US, on Sunday, Jan. 26, 2025. President Donald Trump has pledged to carry out the largest deportation effort in US history, vowing to ultimately deport all of the foreigners living in the country without permission. Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FileIn that Marquette poll, 60% support deporting migrants in the country illegally and 59% support declaring a national emergency at the border, as Trump has done.On the other hand, 57% oppose deporting immigrants who have been in the United States illegally for a number of years, are employed and have no criminal record, although Trump seems likely to deport many such people.Rep. Carlos Giménez, a Miami Republican, generally supports Trump’s immigration policies but has been hearing anger from the large Venezuelan population in his district at Trump’s decision to rescind Temporary Protective Status for refugees from Venezuela, who are in the US legally. Those in his district could be persecuted if they’re deported, Giménez told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Thursday.“It’s up to me as a congressman to represent my constituency,” Gimenez said. “The bad ones” should be taken back, he said, “But there are other folks that really do have fear of repercussion when they go back to Venezuela or Cuba, et cetera. And those people should be treated a little bit differently.”Trump won Miami-Dade County with more than 55% of the vote, and he won 58% of Latino voters in Florida, according to exit polls.Trump is pursuing some sub-40% ideasIn polling from Reuters/Ipsos, there was a lot of support for Trump’s executive actions, including shrinking the size of government and freezing most foreign aid. But only 40% or fewer of Americans supported some of Trump’s more controversial moves. These include:Barring transgender people from serving openly in the militaryEnding federal efforts to prioritize the hiring of women and minoritiesWithdrawing the US from the Paris Climate AccordAttempting to end birthright citizenshipFreezing funding for some services and grantsPardoning January 6 protestersNotably, a majority of Republicans support all of these policies, but even they are opposed to Trump’s plan to place fewer restrictions on how and where artificial intelligence systems are used.In a country of more than 330 million people that provides only two viable options for its leader every four years, it’s to be expected that no one will support everything a president does.That’s especially true when it comes to Trump, who has veered the GOP on a populist course that makes old guard Republicans uncomfortable.The loneliness of Mitch McConnellSen.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/13/politics/eric-adams-trump-justice-department-analysis/index.html,2025-02-14 16:42:00,Drama over Adams case raises questions about Trump administration’s ‘weaponization’ of justice,"Call it the Thursday afternoon massacre.The Justice Department is in crisis after the stunning resignation of the top prosecutor in Manhattan and five other senior officials over the DOJ’s decision to halt the prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams on corruption charges.It took less than a month for Donald Trump’s new DOJ to be engulfed by a controversy that supercharges concerns the president’s political aims are compromising the application of the law.The drama — which recalls the Saturday Night Massacre of Watergate fame — represents the most high-profile effort yet by Justice Department officials to push back against Trump’s DOJ leadership, which is tasked with ending the “weaponization” of justice but which critics fear is perpetuating it.Danielle Sassoon, who quit as the acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York, laid out stunning allegations of political interference in a letter to new Attorney General Pam Bondi. And she said that the New York City mayor’s attorneys had repeatedly urged a quid pro quo under which Adams would help Trump’s hardline immigration policy if the case were dropped.Sassoon wrote that the DOJ’s order for her to dismiss the case against the Democratic mayor was “inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.”An attorney for Adams on Thursday said the idea that there was quid pro quo is “a total lie” and said that the mayor’s legal team was asked by prosecutors whether the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement “and we truthfully answered it did.”Sassoon’s resignation, on the face of it, looks like a courageous act of a prosecutor sacrificing her promising career to thwart an apparent attempt to politicize justice.Her claims add significant new context to a previous Justice Department memo, which argued that the prosecution “unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime” that it said rose under the Biden administration.In itself, that memo was extraordinary since it suggested the prosecution was shelved because it conflicted with the president’s political priorities. The memo, for instance, said that the decision to drop the case was reached without assessing the “strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.”Danielle Sassoon, left, arrives at court, during the trial of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, in New York on March 28, 2024. Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FileSassoon’s complaints were met with a notably brusque letter from Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, who is a former member of Trump’s personal legal team. He accused her of continuing to pursue “a politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to dismiss the case.”Adams, who faces reelection this fall, was indicted in September on charges related to bribery, wire fraud, conspiracy and soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals in exchange for political favors.He has denied all wrongdoing and has frequently said that the prosecution was politically motivated payback for his criticism of the Biden administration’s failure to stem migrant arrivals in New York — a claim the Trump DOJ has embraced.‘Taking politics out of the equation’The administration’s handling of the Adams case seems to show that what Trump says is an effort to purge the “weaponization” of justice is already substituting political, rather than legal, rationales for prosecutorial decisions.“I’m all for de-weaponizing the Justice Department,” Thomas Dupree, a former deputy assistant attorney general, who is also a conservative, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. “But the way you de-weaponize the Justice Department is by taking politics out of the equation.” Dupree said the letters suggested that “the administration was expressly infusing a law enforcement decision with political considerations.”The controversy cast immediate doubt on the future of the DOJ’s attempt to dismiss the case against Adams since the developments are likely to come to the attention of Judge Dale Ho, who needs to sign off on the move.Sassoon resigned before Bove could act upon his plan to fire her, two people familiar with the matter said.But it will be hard for the DOJ to argue that Sassoon is a liberal deep state critic of Trump given that she has impeccable conservative credentials and was only recently picked to lead the SDNY in an acting capacity by the president. She, for instance, clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. In her letter, she said that the conservative icon was among mentors who taught her to uphold the rule of law and advance the public good.Trump denied that he had ordered the Justice Department to dismiss the indictment against Adams, a Democrat who evolved into a prominent critic of former President Joe Biden and built a personal relationship with the current president, who publicly said they were both victims of politicized justice.New York City Mayor Eric Adams exits federal court after his arraignment on bribery and fraud charges on September 27, 2024. John Lamparski/Getty Images/File“No, I didn’t,” Trump told CNN’s Kevin Liptak in the Oval Office. “I know nothing about it. I did not.” Moments later, Trump turned back to Liptak unprompted and added: “That US attorney was actually fired, I don’t know if he or she resigned, but that US attorney was fired.”But the astonishing exchange of﻿ letters and the blistering language used by Bove and Sassoon mean Adams’ case may have the potential to escalate into a major scandal early in the new administration.“We are beyond unusual here, this is thoroughly unprecedented,” CNN legal analyst Elie Honig, who once worked at SDNY, told Anderson Cooper. “We have never seen anything like this.”In her letter, Sassoon argued that the DOJ did not have a valid reason for dismissing the case; said the evidence against Adams was sound; and warned the dismissal would “amplify, rather than abate, concerns about weaponization of the Department.”She recalled her recently taken oath in which she vowed to well and faithfully discharge the duties of her office — and said that arguing for the dismissal of the Adams case in court would conflict with that promise.In one of the most notable sentences of her letter to Bondi, Sassoon faults Bove’s arguments that the Adams case should be dismissed in return for his assistance in enforcing federal immigration laws. She said that the mayor had argued, and Bove apparently agreed, that “Adams should receive leniency for federal crimes solely because he occupies an important public position and can use that position to assist in the Administration’s policy priorities.”This is alarming because establishing such a principle could allow public officials to evade allegations of corruption by dint of their position — a scenario that would risk destroying public confidence in political and legal institutions.Later in her letter, Sassoon took the argument about political weaponization of justice further, writing: “I understand my duty as a prosecutor to mean enforcing the law impartially, and that includes prosecuting a validly returned indictment regardless (of) whether its dismissal would be politically advantageous, to the defendant or to those who appointed me.”Emil Bove, during a sentencing hearing for Donald Trump's hush money conviction in New York, on January 10. A former member of Trump’s personal legal team, Bove is now the acting deputy attorney general. Angela Weiss/Pool/Getty Images/FileBove has now turned to the public integrity section at Justice Department headquarters to handle the dismissal, according to two people familiar with the matter. That step appears to have triggered the resignations of Kevin Driscoll, the top career prosecutor in the public integrity section, and John Keller, the acting head of the office. As many as three additional public integrity prosecutors also tendered their resignations later Thursday, according to two sources.The cascading departures at the Justice Department recalled the “Saturday Night Massacre,” when several prosecutors and officials resigned following special prosecutor Archibald Cox’s refusal to honor President Richard Nixon’s request to drop a subpoena for White House tapes during the Watergate scandal in 1973.“There are some echoes of the worst chapter in recent American history with respect to the Justice Department,” Ryan Goodman, a professor at New York University School of Law, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Thursday.“It’s incredible, it’s here in writing, and I am sure that federal judges across the country are reading these letters and are deeply disturbed about what is happening at the highest levels of the justice department because it seems so corrupt.”‘Integrity and Courage’What is unusual about this case is that the signs of political weaponization of the DOJ can be seen in the official communications of the department itself.For instance, Bove tells Sassoon that she lost sight of her oath because she suggested that she retains, as he wrote, “discretion to interpret the Constitution in a manner inconsistent with the policies of a democratically elected President and a Senate-confirmed Attorney General.”Yet ever since the Watergate scandal, the DOJ has generally sought to maintain a distance from the White House to avoid perceptions of political bias. A prosecutor’s duty is to the Constitution and the neutral administration of justice, not to the policies of a president.Harry Sandick, a former assistant US attorney at SDNY, said Sassoon’s “amazing” letter recalled questions that job candidates in the office are asked about the need to be honest to the court.He told Burnett: “She said, ‘I can’t go into the court and tell (the judge) the things that you would like me to tell him. That would be unethical, it could be inconsistent with my obligations of the prosecutor.’”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.8246429562568665
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/13/politics/musk-trump-reuters-pentagon-defense-contract-fact-check/index.html,2025-02-14 16:24:00,"Fact check: Musk, Trump deceive about a Trump-era Pentagon contract for ‘social deception’ defense","Washington President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk are misleadingly depicting a Pentagon defense contract that was awarded during Trump’s first presidency.The $9.1 million contract was awarded to Thomson Reuters Special Services, a company that provides “data-driven solutions” to the federal government and other clients, to work on defenses against “social engineering” cyberattacks, which use “social deception” tactics to trick humans. In a Wednesday social media post that didn’t explain what the contract was actually for, Musk insinuated that the Reuters news agency, which has the same parent company as Thomson Reuters Special Services, was paid by the government to engage in deception.And neither Musk nor Trump, who made a Thursday post amplifying Musk’s claim, noted that the contract began under Trump in 2018.Asked for comment, Thomson Reuters Special Services chief executive Steve Rubley said in a Thursday statement to CNN that “recent public discourse” has “inaccurately represented the nature of the business between TRSS and the Department of Defense,” and has incorrectly conflated Reuters News with TRSS, a separate legal entity that has its own board of directors and “operates independently from Reuters News.”“TRSS has provided software and information services to U.S. government agencies across successive administrations for decades, to assist in identifying and preventing fraud, supporting public safety, and advancing justice,” Rubley said.Musk continued to post misleadingly about the contract on Thursday even after his misleading Wednesday post was fact-checked by CNN, The Washington Post and others. On Friday, Defense Department spokesperson Lt. Chelsea Dietlin provided CNN with a detailed explanation of the 2018 contract – saying that TRSS was “competitively selected to serve as the evaluator (i.e., red team) to test the defensive tools we were developing” as part of an Active Social Engineering Defense (ASED) program that attempted to combat spear phishing and other social engineering attacks.Specifically, Dietlin said, “TRSS created tools to credibly test the ASED defenses in large-scale, realistic testbed environments. Large-scale Social Deception (LSD) was the name of TRSS’ red team proposal.”What Musk and Trump claimedMusk, the billionaire businessman who is leading the sweeping cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has repeatedly described federal spending in misleading or false ways. This latest example came just one day after he backed away from a false claim that his initiative had thwarted a plan to spend $50 million on condoms for Gaza, conceding that “some of the things that I say will be incorrect.”Musk has previously criticized the Reuters news agency over its coverage of his business ventures. He wrote on his X social media platform on Wednesday night: “Reuters was paid millions of dollars by the US government for ‘large scale social deception’. That is literally what it says on the purchase order! They’re a total scam. Just wow.”Trump then delivered a version of the claim on social media on Thursday morning, adding a demand for repayment: “DOGE: Looks like Radical Left Reuters was paid $9,000,000 by the Department of Defense to study ‘large scale social deception.’ GIVE BACK THE MONEY, NOW!”When CNN asked the White House for comment, an official who spoke on condition of anonymity argued that Trump’s post was not accusing Reuters of engaging in social deception. The official said in a Thursday email, using bold type, that Trump “specifically mentioned the money was used for a study.”Even in the most generous reading of the president’s post, though, his demand for repayment baselessly suggested that the contract was improper – and his use of “Reuters” at the very least left open the impression that the money went to the well-known news agency rather than the lesser-known Thomson Reuters Special Services, the company name listed on the public document Musk shared.What the contract was actually forWashington Post technology reporter Drew Harwell offered a thorough debunking on Thursday morning in response to Musk’s post.As Harwell noted, detailed information about the contract has long been publicly available on the US government’s spending disclosure website. The contract, which was awarded after a public bidding process, was funded by the Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which develops new technologies for the military.The nature of the contract was described, in the brief and vague manner typical of federal contract descriptions, as “ACTIVE SOCIAL ENGINEERING DEFENSE (ASED) LARGE SCALE SOCIAL DECEPTION (LSD).” Those words might sound nefarious to someone who did no further research – but even before the Defense Department provided its Friday comment, there was ample public information on what the contract was about.DARPA explained on its website that it was seeking to develop technology to “automatically identify, disrupt, and investigate social engineering attacks” – attacks known as “social engineering” because they try to deceive or “engineer” humans into performing certain actions, like clicking on links to malicious software, divulging sensitive information or giving up money.For example, a foreign adversary might have operatives posing online as attractive potential dating matches to lure members of the US military into revealing information to them or granting them access to sensitive systems. While seeking competitive bids in 2017, the Pentagon publicly outlined its desire to create its own highly sophisticated bots to figure out who is behind these kinds of attacks.A program description posted online by DARPA in 2017 explained that “the core technology to be developed in this program is the capability to automatically elicit information from a malicious adversary in order to identify, disrupt, and investigate social engineering attacks.” The description said that the Active Social Engineering Defense (ASED) “will do this by mediating communications between users and potential attackers with bots that actively detect attacks and coordinate investigations to discover the identity of the attacker.”The document said that “when an attack is detected, the ASED program envisions the use of automated, virtual, alter-ego bots to coordinate active investigation and tracing of the attacker’s identity.”This article has been updated with additional information.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9987913966178894
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/13/tech/china-apple-alibaba-ai-hnk-intl/index.html,2025-02-13 16:54:00,Apple picks Alibaba to launch AI features in China,"Hong Kong Apple will work with Chinese tech giant Alibaba to roll out AI services in the world’s biggest market for mobile phones, in a move that removes months of uncertainty for the Cupertino-based firm.“Apple has been very selective. They talked to a number of companies in China, and in the end, they choose to do business with us. They want to use our AI to power their phones,” Joe Tsai, chairman of Alibaba, said on Thursday during a speech at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.He did not provide further details like a timeline for the release or whether Alibaba will be the exclusive partner.News of the partnership was first reported by The Information. It said Apple also considered other Chinese AI firms like DeepSeek, Baidu, ByteDance and Tencent before ultimately selecting Alibaba.CNN has reached out to Apple and Alibaba for further comment.Due to local compliance issues and regulatory concerns, Apple has so far only been able to release its AI service, Apple Intelligence, to limited markets, including the US, Canda, UK and Australia. The Chinese government mandates that foreign AI operators need to partner with a local company and obtain regulatory approval.Apple has been losing market share in China to domestic rivals such as Huawei and Vivo. Lucas Zhong, research analyst at Canalys, a market research firm, said while AI services are expected to help Apple gain users in China, challenges remain.“Apple faces a much more challenging competitive landscape in China, especially amid Huawei’s strong resurgence. Relying solely on AI services may not be enough to turn the tide,” he said.Apple had dominated China’s high-end smartphone market for years before Huawei rose through the ranks and began posing a credible challenge. But in 2019, US President Donald Trump moved to impose trade restrictions on Huawei.Initially, those curbs hit Huawei’s business hard. But eventually, they incentivized Huawei to adapt and innovate, which culminated at the launch of Mate 60 Pro in 2023 that triggered an US government’s investigation. Huawei’s transformation, coupled with strong patriotic sentiment among some Chinese people, has powered its rise.Last year, Huawei, posted a market share of 16% in China, overtaking Apple’s 15%, according to Canalys data. In 2023, Apple was the top mobile phone seller in the country with 19% of market share. Huawei trailed behind at 12%.The confirmed partnership with Apple has boosted investors’ confidence in Alibaba. Its Hong Kong-listed shares has surged by more than 40% since hitting a two-year low in January.Shortly after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled an AI model in January that stunned Wall Street, Alibaba unveiled its latest version of its Qwen AI model, saying it was better than its competitor’s R1 model.Speaking at the same event on Thursday via video, Elon Musk, said the next generation of his company xAI’s large language model, Grok 3, would be released in one to two weeks, touting it as the best AI chatbot on the market.“In the tests that we’ve done thus far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that’s been released, that we’re aware of,” the tech mogul said.Musk founded xAI with the goal of challenging OpenAI, the company he co-founded, as well as other AI giants like Google.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9829742908477783

Musk announced Monday that he is leading a group of investors who have offered to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion, but on Wednesday said he is prepared to drop the matter if OpenAI sticks with what Musk believes is its founding mission.“If OpenAI, Inc.’s Board is prepared to preserve the charity’s mission and stipulate to take the for sale’ sign off its assets by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid,” Musk said in a court filing late Wednesday. “Otherwise, the charity must be compensated by what an arm’s-length buyer will pay for its assets.”Altman has lambasted the offer publicly, and the company in a court filing Wednesday questioned Musk’s rationale for the bid — though it has not yet rejected it.The company in its filing Wednesday accused Musk of hypocrisy. Musk sued OpenAI in 2024 for allegedly violating its founding charter, and he demanded that the company remain under the control of a nonprofit. But in his bid, OpenAI noted Musk wants the company to be sold — to himself.“In this Court, Musk argues that OpenAI, Inc.’s assets cannot be ‘transferred away’ for ‘private gain,’ the company said in a legal filing. “But out of court, those constraints evidently do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers. Musk would have OpenAI, Inc. transfer all of its assets to him, for his economic benefit and that of his competing AI business and hand-picked private investors.”A lawyer representing Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A lawyer representing OpenAI said the company has stated OpenAI’s nonprofit is not for sale, and unlike a for-profit company, OpenAI has no obligation to consider Musk’s bid.“The independent Board’s sole fiduciary duty is to the mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity,” said Andrew Nussbaum, counsel to the OpenAI Board at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. “Respectfully, it is not up to a competitor to decide what is in the best interests of OpenAI’s mission.”OpenAI is operated by a nonprofit organization that controls an entity called OpenAI LP, a for-profit company. That for-profit company took OpenAI from effectively worthless to a valuation of around $100 billion in just a few years — and Altman is largely credited as the mastermind of that plan and the key to OpenAI’s success.OpenAI has announced plans to spin out its for-profit entity to give it more financial leeway. Musk, a cofounder of OpenAI who eventually left the company, claims that structure change would break with OpenAI’s founding charter, because it would focus on making a profit with its AI tools.Musk has long feuded with Altman and has filed a number of legal complaints against both the company and Altman, claiming that the AI company and its leadership have misrepresented OpenAI as a philanthropy.“OpenAI has gotten this far while having at least dual nonprofit/for-profit role. What they’re trying to do now is completely delete the nonprofit. And that seems really going too far,” Musk said in a Q&A session at the World Government Summit in Dubai Thursday morning. “This is analogous to if you fund a nonprofit to preserve the Amazon rainforest but instead they turn it into a lumber company and chop down trees and sell them for wood, you’d be like: ‘Wait a second, that’s the exact opposite of what I donated the money for.’”Altman on Tuesday called Musk unhappy and insecure, and he speculated: “I think he’s probably just trying to slow us down.”CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report.This is a developing story and will be updated.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9958049058914185

Now it’s hitting Western cinemas","Hong Kong An unruly Chinese boy who battles dragons and defies destiny has made his way to Western cinema screens after smashing box office records in China.“Ne Zha 2,” an animated blockbuster loosely based on Chinese mythology, is now the world’s highest-grossing movie of all time in a single market, racking up a staggering $1.4 billion in ticket sales in China since its January 29 release.It dwarfs the previous record held by “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which netted $936 million in the United States and Canada in 2015. The Chinese production is also the first non-Hollywood film to break into the all-time global top 20 of highest-grossing films.The phenomenal success of “Ne Zha 2” – a rare bright spot in China’s otherwise sluggish box office amid a struggling economy – has sparked a wave of national pride and jubilation, with audiences, state media and officials rushing to celebrate the landmark achievement.For decades, China’s movie market had been dominated by Hollywood blockbusters. But in recent years, homegrown titles – in genres from action and sci-fi to romance and animation – have increasingly outpaced Western films, a pivot fueled by rising cultural pride, more sophisticated storytelling and rapid technological progress.And as censorship tightens and geopolitical tensions with the United States flare, it’s become all the more difficult for Hollywood to navigate political landmines in the once-lucrative market.China’s domestic film industry has pounced on the opportunity. Animation rooted in traditional Chinese folklore, enhanced with state-of-the-art special effects, has proven to be a winning formula.For a new generation of Chinese filmmakers and audiences, the reasoning is clear: If China’s own talent can deliver high-quality adaptions of the legends they grew up with, why rely on Western studios to tell Chinese stories?Following its record-breaking run in China, “Ne Zha 2” has headed overseas, with wide releases in Australia and New Zealand on Thursday and North America on Friday. It became an instant hit among the Chinese diaspora – many rushed to snap up presale tickets days in advance and lined up for its premieres.“Even those who weren’t previously interested in anime, like me, are drawn to this movie because of the enthusiasm and the glowing word of mouth in China,” said Summer Wang, a data analyst who attended the film’s premiere in Los Angeles.Stephanie Zhan, 30, a jewelry sales manager in Sydney, spent an hour getting to a cinema in a severe thunderstorm to watch “Ne Zha 2.” The audience, mostly of Chinese descent, erupted in applause at the end of the screening, she said.“It had a complete story arc with nuanced emotions, funny moments and the fight scenes were spectacular – on par with the epic battles in something like ‘The Avengers.’ It was truly impressive,” she said. “I feel hopeful about domestic films now.”Buildings are lit up with characters from 'Ne Zha 2' in Chengdu on February 12, 2025. AFP/Getty ImagesThe success formulaThe sequel to a 2019 box office champion, all the stars aligned for “Ne Zha 2” to become a smash hit.The film faced few serious competitors upon its release at the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, a peak cinema-going time for the whole family in China.Drawing on a 16th-century novel, the film features characters familiar to Chinese audiences of all ages. But it also offers fresh takes that resonate with the young generation, said Xiaoning Lu, an expert on Chinese cinema at SOAS University of London.“It’s a very successful commercial film. On one hand, it’s got advanced animation technology, and on the other, it excels in storytelling. It’s family-friendly, fun to watch with a touch of rebellious spirit,” Lu said. “In fact, it’s a mixture of different formulas that came together and worked.”Born with a demonic fate and extraordinary powers, the protagonist, Ne Zha, is “ugly cute” and mischievous, unafraid to challenge heavenly authority and confront the gods who have manipulated power to suit their own ends.“The messages it conveys resonate with different audiences and reflect many of the challenges of our times, such as challenging the established structure, institution and authority; themes of family love and friendship; distrust of the system and authority; and identity confusion,” said Sabrina Qiong Yu, a film and Chinese studies professor at Newcastle University. “It’s like ‘chicken soup for the soul’ or a shot of excitement in the gloomy atmosphere of the era.”The film also invites open interpretation, with some nationalist viewers excited to spot “Easter eggs” they interpret as political metaphors mocking America — such as objects resembling US dollar signs, the Great Seal of the United States, the Pentagon and the coronavirus.Yu, who watched the movie in China, said she heard many audience members discussing these nationalist elements. “While I didn’t feel this strongly when watching the film, I do think it might have contributed to its box office success,” she said.Many recent Chinese blockbusters have capitalized on rising nationalist sentiment, achieving massive success. “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” a 2021 government-commissioned war flick, was previously China’s top-grossing title after taking the top spot from 2017 patriotic action movie “Wolf Warrior 2.”A child runs past a poster promoting 'Ne Zha 2' in Beijing on February 11, 2025. Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty ImagesNational prideAs it shattered box office records, “Ne Zha 2” quickly emerged as a triumph of China’s animation and film industries.The movie was made entirely in China, involving 138 animation companies and more than 4,000 crew, according to its end credits.Its director Yang Yu, a medical major turned animation filmmaker, told state broadcaster CCTV that he initially approached international production teams for some key scenes, but the results fell short of expectations.“Sure, they might be a top-tier studio, but they could be using third-rate staff on our project. So, after outsourcing, many of the shots didn’t turn out as we wanted, and we ended up bringing them back,” he said.Yang conceded that Chinese studios are still playing catch-up with top foreign counterparts in technologies and industrial processes, though the gap is closing.China’s animation industry has come a long way. In a market where generations of audiences grew up watching movies from Hollywood’s Disney and Pixar and Japan’s Studio Ghibli, a growing number of domestic animations have broken through in recent years, especially those championing traditional culture.It’s a similar story in other entertainment sectors. Last year, “Black Myth: Wukong,” a Chinese video game based on classical 16th-century novel “Journey to the West” and featuring cutting-edge graphics, became an international bestseller.As “Ne Zha 2” box office receipts surpassed Hollywood classics one after another, Chinese moviegoers rallied to support the film and push its ticket sales to new heights.On Chinese social media, users called on each other to hit the cinema – and even watch it multiple times. A trending hashtag on microblogging site Weibo compared the film’s rise through global box office ranks to “raising the national flag.”On Thursday night, the film hit a landmark 100 billion yuan ($13.7 billion) in ticket sales, overtaking “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” to become the third-highest-grossing animated film ever, just behind “Frozen 2.”State media and Chinese officials have piled praise on “Ne Zha 2,” hailing it as a prime example of China’s growing “cultural confidence.”China’s ambassador to Washington, Xie Feng, promoted the movie in multiple posts on X and in speeches. Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, called the film “a new bridge for cultural exchanges between China and the world and a new window on China for the world.”However, “Ne Zha 2” faces a major challenge in gaining a strong foothold in overseas markets, where it will compete with the newly released “Captain America: Brave New World.” And beyond the Chinese diaspora, it may struggle to connect with a broader international audience, viewers and experts say.“I do not see it having the same potential to transcend cultural boundaries and achieve significant box office success overseas as ‘Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon’ did at the start of this century,” said Yu, from Newcastle University.“But I could be wrong. Good luck to its overseas release.”",cnn,POSITIVE,0.9993723034858704

Allen said in a statement.The New York Post first reported the news on Wednesday.The investigation’s apparent termination comes less than a week after a grand jury and a federal appeals court examined whether WWE founder McMahon committed a crime by hiding allegations of sexual misconduct from two former female employees — whom he allegedly paid more than $10 million in exchange for signing nondisclosure agreements.McMahon and his former lawyer allegedly hid the allegations and payments from the company, including sharing “the executed agreement via text instead of email for the express purpose of avoiding the Company gaining knowledge of it,” according to the court ruling last Friday.While neither McMahon nor the attorney are explicitly named in the ruling, the description matches him and a source confirmed to CNN that McMahon is indeed the chief executive in question.Despite the new court documents, Allen said the matter is now closed and the new filing is “simply the result of an appeal of a procedural matter that was argued five months ago.”Legal battleIn 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported McMahon had paid more than $12 million to four women formerly employed by WWE over 16 years to silence claims of sexual misconduct. This included one former WWE wrestler who claimed McMahon had coerced her into performing oral sex, only to demote and eventually opt to not renew her contract after she declined subsequent sexual advances.The news story followed a separate Journal report that WWE’s board was looking into McMahon for quietly agreeing to pay a $3 million settlement to a former staffer — eventually one of the four mentioned in the Journal’s story — with whom he allegedly had an affair. At the time, McMahon pledged he would cooperate with the investigation and “accept the findings and outcome of the investigation, whatever they are.”In January 2023, the Journal reported McMahon had inked a multimillion-dollar settlement with the first woman to referee the World Wrestling Federation — which became WWE in 2002 — after the former staffer accused him of rape in a letter. An attorney for McMahon asserted that he “denies and always has denied” the sexual assault, specifying that he had “settled the case solely to avoid the cost of litigation.”Yet another ex-WWE employee who had worked at the company’s headquarters sued McMahon in January 2024, accusing him of sexual assault, trafficking, and physical abuse. A spokesperson for McMahon at the time described the lawsuit as “replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and a vindictive distortion of the truth.”The former staffer from the January 2024 lawsuit is not named in the new ruling, but a description of the second victim’s agreement matches reports of her account.McMahon resigned from his dual WWE roles in 2022, only to return in January 2023 as executive chairman of the board. In September of that year, the company became TKO after WWE’s merger with rival network UFC. In January 2024, following the sexual misconduct allegations — which McMahon denied — he quickly resigned his executive chairman and board director roles at TKO.In June 2024, a federal judge ruled that the government had established “probable cause to believe” that McMahon and one of his former lawyers had broken the law when they “circumvented (the company’s) internal controls and created false books and records.” The appellate court’s new filing Tuesday affirmed the lower court’s ruling.In October, McMahon and his wife Linda — President Trump’s choice for Education Secretary — were sued by five former WWE “Ring Boys” for allegedly allowing a former ringside announcer to use his position to sexually exploit children as young as 12 starting in the 1980s. Vince and Linda McMahon have denied the allegations.In separate legal troubles, just last month McMahon paid $1.7 million to settle charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to his alleged failure to properly disclose $19.6 million in unrecorded expenses to the company’s board.McMahon touted the SEC settlement as vindication of his maintained innocence following years of allegations and reports.“There was never anything more to this than minor accounting errors with regard to some personal payments that I made several years ago while I was CEO of WWE,” McMahon said in a January statement. “I’m thrilled that I can now put all this behind me.”WWE and TKO did not respond to requests for comment.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9976556301116943

But other countries do not reco﻿gnize the new name, and the AP has customers around the world, so it still refers to the Gulf of Mexico while also acknowledging Trump’s decree.Other global news outlets have made similar decisions.But this week the White House singled out the AP and barred its reporters from presidential events.Photographers for the AP were still allowed to attend.Shortly before Trump departed the White House for Mar-a-Lago on Friday, the administration confirmed that the AP would not be allowed on Air Force One for the trip, either.In a statement on X, deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich pointed to the Gulf dispute, saying the AP’s decision “is not just divisive, but it also exposes the Associated Press’ commitment to misinformation.”“While their right to irresponsible and dishonest reporting is protected by the First Amendment, it does not ensure their privilege of unfettered access to limited spaces, like the Oval Office and Air Force One,” Budowich wrote. “Going forward, that space will now be opened up to the many thousands of reporters who have been barred from covering these intimate areas of the administration.”He said AP journalists would retain credentials to the White House grounds.But blocking the AP from what are known as “pooled” events, such as Air Force One flights, interferes with the news outlet’s ability to do its job.The “press pool” travels with the president at all times and shares information with the wider press corps. The AP is so foundational to White House coverage that it helped create the pool in the first place.“The first known instance of a so-called pool reporter inside the White House was in 1881 after President James A. Garfield was shot,” the AP explained earlier this week. “As the chief executive lay in bed, AP reporter Franklin Trusdell sat outside his sick room, listening to him breathe and sharing updates with other correspondents.”The AP, a cooperative that transmits news to thousands of clients, has been a member of the pool ever since.The AP did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Friday statement.The wire service has repeatedly signaled that it is preparing a legal challenge. As one AP staffer remarked on condition of anonymity, “It’s hard to come up with a clearer case of viewpoint discrimination.”The White House Correspondents Association determines which outlets are part of the pool rotation. The AP is included every day, but with the ban in place, that may be reassessed.On Thursday, the WHCA, which represents the press corps, said the action against the AP “is a textbook violation of not only the First Amendment, but the president’s own executive order on freedom of speech and ending federal censorship.”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9914632439613342
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/14/politics/trump-dei-initiatives-demographic-shifts/index.html,2025-02-14 18:00:00,The real obstacle for Trump’s campaign against DEI isn’t Democrats. It’s demography,"The escalating drive from President Donald Trump and other Republicans against programs to promote greater diversity in education and employment is on a collision course with fundamental changes in the nation’s demographic make-up, particularly among the young.Conservative opponents of diversity initiatives have clearly seized the momentum in the policy debate. In 2023, the six Republican-appointed Supreme Court Justices joined in a decisive ruling to virtually eliminate the consideration of race of college admissions. Since taking office, Trump has followed with a flurry of executive orders to end “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs within the federal government and to penalize private employers that utilize them — even to the point of potentially seeking criminal prosecutions. Facing this pressure, prominent companies in recent months have publicly renounced efforts to increase diversity in hiring or contracting. Democrats have been tentative and divided over how hard to push back against the conservative drive to eradicate the so-called DEI programs.But this diversity counteroffensive is advancing precisely as kids of color have become a solid majority of the nation’s youth. Since the start of the 21st century, young Whites have been rapidly declining not only as a share of the overall youth population, but also in their absolute numbers — to an extent possibly unprecedented in American history. This tectonic reshaping of the American population means that demography, not Democrats, will likely emerge as the biggest obstacle to Trump’s campaign to uproot DEI programs across US society.These demographic trends ensure that in the years ahead, the nation will increasingly rely on non-White young people as an increasing portion of its students, workers and taxpayers. Yet today, minority young people remain tremendously underrepresented at the most exclusive colleges and universities and in high-level, well-paying jobs across the private sector.Abandoning diversity programs even as the nation continues to grow more diverse could expose US society to two distinct risks. One is that as minorities make up a growing share of the future workforce, failing to equip more of them with advanced academic and technical skills could leave the nation short of the highly trained workers it will need as it transitions further into the information-age economy.“The future of the nation’s labor force productivity and economic well-being will rely heavily on the success and integration of today’s and tomorrow’s increasingly multiracial younger population,” William Frey, a demographer at the center-left Brookings Metro think tank, wrote recently.The other big risk is that under current trends the US could harden into a more overtly two-tier society, with a widening gap between the growing overall presence of minorities in the population and their limited representation in the most prestigious educational and employment opportunities. That could be a formula for even more social turbulence and alienation than the US has already experienced around current racial disparities.The pushback against diversity programs “is an attempt to entrench racial discrimination and disparities at every level of society and to horde power and influence among what will soon be a minority population of White people and the wealthy,” said Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the Legal Defense Fund, a leading civil rights organization.“Relegating … marginalized groups to second-class citizenship will upend the American experiment of multiracial democracy and reinstate a caste system — and that is the point. Indeed, if unchecked, these efforts will create levels of disenfranchisement and disillusionment yet unseen in our modern history,” Nelson said.Opponents of diversity programs argue there’s no reason for concern even if White people hold on to most of the prestigious educational and employment opportunities as their overall numbers shrink. “I think we need to get away from being concerned about the skin color of those who are occupying those positions,” said Jonathan Butcher, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “I think we need to move to a point where we are concerned about what the individuals accomplish once they are there.”But civil rights advocates argue Trump and his allies are brewing a recipe for both social and economic strain by hobbling efforts to expand opportunities for minorities exactly as they represent more of the nation’s future workforce. To these critics, the drive by Trump and his Republican allies to dismantle diversity programs at this transitional moment amounts to raising the castle walls of privilege against a rising tide of demographic change.“If institutional gatekeepers don’t ensure equal access to opportunity, this country will become even more dangerously stratified by race and future generations of Americans will be wholly incapable of meeting the challenges of an increasingly global landscape,” said Nelson. “This is a recipe for disaster.”Janai Nelson speaks at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC, on May 17, 2024. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty ImagesIn this century, the change in the demographic composition of America’s youth population has been swift and sustained. Kids of color increased their share of the nation’s total under-18 population from 39.1% in 2000 to 51.6% in 2023, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data provided to CNN by Frey.This change has been broadly felt. Over that period, the minority share of the youth population has increased in all 50 states, according to Frey’s calculations. In 18 states, kids of color already constitute more than half of the youth population. In six other states, minority kids make up at least 46% of the youth population, suggesting they will become the majority group before long.The change in the absolute numbers of the youth population may be even more revealing than these shifts in its proportions. Since 2000, the number of non-White kids has increased by just over 9.3 million, Frey found. Over that same period, the number of White kids has declined by nearly 8.8 million. In 47 of the 50 states, not only has the share of Whites younger than 18 declined since 2000, but so has their absolute number. The only states that have more White kids today than at the turn of the 21st century are Utah, Idaho and South Carolina — and even they have seen only small increases, totaling about 120,000 between them. By contrast, 30 states have at least 75,000 fewer White kids today than they did in 2000.Frey has calculated from Census data that the number of White kids shrank from 2000 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2020, and continued to fall from 2020 to 2023. He says there is likely no precedent in American history for such an extended decline in the number of White young people. Something similar may have happened “during the Great Depression for a few years,” Frey told me. “That’s possible. But for most of our history as a country we’ve been growing. It’s fair to say that this is the first time we’ve seen a decline like this for this length of time.”Nor does Frey see much possibility that the decline in both the share and absolute number of White kids will reverse any time soon. “I don’t see this decline reversing, because the White population is older and women in their child-bearing ages are getting to be a smaller share of that group,” Frey told me. Immigration, he adds, isn’t likely to add many more White kids since most legal migrants, come from predominantly non-White countries. The Census projects the minority share of the youth population will reach 53% by 2030 and 60% by 2050.All of this guarantees that non-White kids will represent the principal source of workers for the 21st-century economy. As recently as 2000, White kids still represented nearly 70% of all high school graduates, according to the federal National Center for Education Statistics. But in the 2021-22 school year, young White people, for the first time, fell below the majority of high school graduates (at 49.4%), and their share has continued to tumble: The National Center projects that Whites will slip to 46% of all high school graduates next June and to as little as 43% of the graduating class in 2031. The NCES projects that 300,000 fewer White kids will graduate high school this year than in 2008.Enrollment in postsecondary education is moving along the same track. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce reported in a study last year that the number of White students attending colleges and universities plummeted by 375,000 from 2009 to 2019, the latest year for which they calculated detailed figures by race; the number of Black students tumbled by nearly 100,000 as well. All the growth in postsecondary attendance over that period came from Latino students (up about 190,000) and, to a much lesser, extent Asian Americans (up nearly 20,000).Yet kids of color continue to face systemic inequities at each stage of the journey from education into the workforce. Research, for instance, has consistently shown that student performance lags in elementary and secondary schools where poverty is pervasive; today, about three-fourths of Black and Latino students, compared to only about one-third of their Asian American and White counterparts, attend schools where at least half of students qualify as poor under federal definitions, according to the National Equity Atlas published by PolicyLink, a research and advocacy group, and the Equity Research Institute at the University of Southern California.Higher education likewise remains substantially stratified by race. About two-thirds of both Black and Latino students, Georgetown found, attend so-called open-access colleges, which are the least competitive in admissions and spend less than half the money and employ less than half the faculty per student as more selective schools. Though Black, Latino and Native American students have grown to 37% of the total postsecondary student body, they hold only 21% of the seats in roughly the 500 most selective schools. White and Asian American students, by contrast, still constitute nearly three-fourths of all those attending the most selective institutions, the Georgetown center found, far beyond their three-in-five share of the total postsecondary student population. While about four-fifths of students at the selective colleges finish their degrees, that’s true for less than half of those at the open-access institutions.Jackson State University President Marcus Thompson, center, joins Black Men United in welcoming the families and friends of first-year and transfer students by distributing supply kits and other essentials on move-in day on August 10. Aron Smith/Jackson State University/Getty Images“Open-access institutions educate the vast majority of college students, but, unfortunately, do so with the fewest resources and have the lowest success rates,” the Georgetown Center concluded in its 2024 report. “The American postsecondary system, in other words, tends to provide the highest-quality education to those who need it least: students who are primarily wealthier than the median and who attended well-resourced high schools that smooth the transition into the most-selective colleges.”This pipeline of educational inequality ultimately terminates in widely unequal outcomes in the job market. The average hourly wages of Black and Latino workers remain about 11% lower than the wages for White workers — a wider gap than in 1979 for both minority groups, according to an analysis of federal data by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. Ben Zipperer, an EPI senior economist, has calculated that although Whites make up about 58% of all workers, they represent 68% of those whose wages put them in the top fifth of highest earners. Black and Latino workers, though nearly one-third of all workers, are just a little more than one-sixth of those at the top, wage-wise.Nelson of the LDF points to other measures of enduring inequality. Across the 100 largest companies listed on the S&P stock index, Black, Latino and Asian Americans hold less than one-fourth of upper management jobs, according to a Harvard Law School analysis.“Black and Latinx people,” she added, “make up fewer than 1% and 2% of Venture Capital entrepreneurs, respectively, according to a Harvard Business School analysis.” Despite some gains, women remain significantly underrepresented on both fronts, too, she noted. Though women obtain about 60% of all four-year undergraduate degrees and nearly two-thirds of all post-graduate degrees, the Harvard Law analysis found they hold only slightly more than one in four of those upper management jobs in large companies, little more than racial minorities.Less precisely quantifiable, but potentially just as important, these educational inequities also yield enduring racial disparities in what could be called the C-suite of American life —the positions that wield decision-making power in our major public and private institutions. Zack Mabel, director of research at the Georgetown Center, notes that the elite universities where Black and Latino students remain systematically underrepresented have long functioned as the conveyor belt producing most of the people who occupy those roles.“There’s so much concentrated power in decision making that grows up out of these selective institutions and as a society I would argue we are in desperate need of diversifying access to those bastions of power,” Mabel said. “The only realistic way we are going to do that is by diversifying our selective institutions.”Despite these entrenched disparities, polls for years have shown that most Americans, including many racial minorities, express opposition to “affirmative action” or diversity programs that explicitly elevate racial considerations above ostensibly neutral concepts of merit in employment or college admissions.And after a campaign in which Trump relentlessly attacked diversity efforts, his election day gains compared to 2020 among Latinos, Asian Americans and Black men, demonstrated at the least that his hostility to such programs was not a deal-breaker for many non-White voters.Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Trump’s gains with non-White voters didn’t surprise him. Trump’s improvement on that front showed that the argument over diversity programs “is part of the elite discourse that working- and lower-middle-class families of color typically aren’t that bought into,” Cox said. “Your average working-class kid, the idea of going to Harvard is like the idea of going to the moon. It’s a long shot; that’s not the thing that is going to be life-changing or game-changing for them. Better opportunities where they live, cheaper housing where they live, lower crime — those are the things that are going to be game-changing for them.”President Donald Trump signs a memorandum at the White House on January 30 ordering an immediate assessment of aviation safety and a rollback of federal DEI policies. Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesManuel Pastor, director of the Equity Research Institute at USC, agreed that Trump’s gains with minority voters came in part because diversity programs in education and employment don’t “always reach working-class people of color in real, concrete material ways.” And Pastor believes that the backlash against diversity programs intensified because too many morphed into formulaic workplace trainings that “became often more symbolic and about discourse and how about how people feel than they were about recognizing historic disparities and giving people a leg up into the workplace.”But, Pastor argues, none of that erases the core demographic reality that the US will increasingly rely for its future workers on kids of color who are on the wrong end of compounding disparities in educational and employment opportunity. Abandoning diversity programs now, he argues, “means wasted talent. It means lost Einsteins. It means not investing in the productivity that we need for the future.”Like other critics of diversity programs, Butcher, the Heritage Foundation senior fellow, argues that trying to channel more minority students into elite educational institutions “is a dangerous policy to engineer from the top. I think there is no centralized control or bureaucracy that could effectively engineer those kinds of outcomes without serious unintended consequences.” Even if the rollback of diversity programs widens the gap between White and non-White young people, Butcher said, “I don’t believe that just because there would be different outcomes for individuals based on race that it necessarily represents racism.”Amid the furious counteroffensive against diversity programs from conservatives wielding such arguments, defenders of these efforts are likely to shift their arguments over time more from equity to economic grounds.One of the defining demographic realities of modern America is the enormous racial divergence between America’s youngest and oldest generations, a dynamic Frey has called the “cultural generation gap” and I’ve described as the contrast between “the brown and the gray.” Even as minorities have grown into a majority of the youth population, and advance toward becoming most of the working-age population, about three-fourths of seniors remain White (primarily because the US virtually shut off immigration from 1924 to 1965).This racial transformation has been occurring even as the number of seniors, as Frey has documented, has been growing more than nine times as fast as the working-age population. That means, to pay the payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare, a rapidly growing population of White seniors will depend on a workforce that is increasing only modestly in numbers but rapidly becoming more diverse.That creates a shared interest across racial and generational lines that is rarely discussed in American politics. If kids of color continue to face the educational disparities evident today, the danger isn’t just that the economy overall will face shortages of skilled workers as those kids become a larger share of the future workforce. Ultimately, the mostly White senior population also needs more kids of color to ascend into well-paying jobs where they can be taxed to meet the growing cost of the big federal programs for the elderly. Ending diversity programs now increases the risk that the US will fail to produce as many skilled minority workers as it needs on both fronts, advocates argue.“The people we overlook for investments is going to shipwreck the future for America writ large, but especially for a whiter, older retired population that is counting on this (diverse) younger population to contribute” to their retirement costs, Pastor said.Frey said that sooner or later, the US will recognize that it must open more educational and employment opportunities for non-White young people because there simply will not be enough White kids available to fill all the skilled jobs the economy will demand. “To talk about getting rid of DEI is just being blind to demography,” Frey says. “Sooner or later, we are going to run out of (White) people even in those top jobs.”In the meantime, though, the politics of diversity are now moving in the opposite direction of the demographic and economic imperatives of an irreversibly diversifying nation.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.8766551613807678
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/14/tech/deepseek-ai-openai-hype/index.html,2025-02-14 18:30:00,"The real hype behind DeepSeek, according to AI experts","DeepSeek turned the tech world on its head last month – and for good reason, according to artificial intelligence experts, who say we’re likely only seeing the beginning of the Chinese tech startup’s influence on the AI field.DeepSeek grabbed headlines in late January with its R1 AI model, which the company says can roughly match the performance of Open AI’s o1 model at a fraction of the cost. Tech stocks tumbled as DeepSeek briefly unseated ChatGPT to become the top app in Apple’s App Store.The achievement pushed US tech behemoths to question America’s standing in the AI race against China – and the billions of dollars behind those efforts. While Vice President JD Vance didn’t mention DeepSeek or China by name in his remarks at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris on Tuesday, he certainly emphasized how big of a priority it is for the United States to lead the sector.“The United States of America is the leader in AI, and our administration plans to keep it that way,” he said, although he added that “America wants to partner” with other countries.But it’s not just DeepSeek’s efficiency and power. The way DeepSeek R1 can reason and “think” through answers to provide quality results, along with the company’s decision to make key parts of its technology publicly available, will also push the field forward, experts say.While AI has long been used in tech products, it’s reached a flashpoint over the last two years thanks to the rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI services that have reshaped the way people work, communicate and find information. It’s made Wall Street darlings out of companies like chipmaker Nvidia and upended the trajectory of Silicon Valley giants. So any development that can help build more capable and efficient models is sure to be closely watched.“This is definitely not hype,” said Oren Etzioni, former CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. “But also, this is a very fast-moving world.”AI’s TikTok momentTech leaders have been quick to respond to DeepSeek’s rise. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis called the hype around DeepSeek “exaggerated , ” but also said its model as “probably the best work I’ve seen come out of China,” according to CNBC.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company’s quarterly earnings call in January that DeepSeek has some “real innovations,” while Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the iPhone maker’s earnings call that “innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing.”But the attention hasn’t all been positive. Semiconductor researcher SemiAnalysis cast doubt over DeepSeek’s claims that it only cost $5.6 million to train. OpenAI told The Financial Times it found evidence that DeepSeek used the US company’s models to train its own competitor.“We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a comment to CNN. DeepSeek could not immediately be reached for comment.And a pair of US lawmakers has already called for the app to be banned from government devices after security researchers highlighted its potential links to the Chinese government, as the Associated Press and ABC News reported. Similar concerns have been raised about the popular social media app TikTok, which must be sold to an American owner or risk being banned in the US.“DeepSeek is the TikTok of (large language models),” Etzioni said.DeepSeek’s deep impression on the tech worldTech giants are already thinking about how DeepSeek’s technology can influence their products and services.“What DeepSeek gave us was essentially the recipe in the form of a tech report, but they didn’t give us the extra missing parts,” said Lewis Tunstall, a senior research scientist at Hugging Face, an AI platform that offers tools for developers.Tunstall is leading an effort at Hugging Face to fully open source DeepSeek’s R1 model; while DeepSeek provided a research paper and the model’s parameters, it didn’t reveal the code or training data.Nadella said on Microsoft’s earnings call that Windows Copilot+ PCs, or PCs built to a certain spec to support AI models, will be able to run AI models distilled from DeepSeek R1 locally. Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm said on Tuesday that models distilled from DeepSeek R1 were running on smartphones and PCs powered by its chips within a week.AI researchers, academics and developers are still exploring what DeepSeek means for the advancement of AI.DeepSeek’s model isn’t the only open-source one, nor is it the first to be able to reason over answers before responding; OpenAI’s o1 model from last year can do that, too.What makes DeepSeek significant is the way it can reason and learn from other models, along with the fact that the AI community can see what’s happening behind the scenes. Those who use the R1 model in DeepSeek’s app can also see its “thought” process as it answers questions.“You can see the wheels turning inside the machine,” Durga Malladi, senior vice president and general manager for technology planning and edge solutions at Qualcomm, said to CNN.Tunstall thinks we may see a wave of new models that can reason like DeepSeek in the not-too-distant future. That could be critical as tech giants race to build AI agents, which Silicon Valley generally believes are the next evolution of the chatbot and how consumers will interact with devices – although that shift hasn’t quite happened yet.Grok 3, the next iteration of the chatbot on the social media platform X, will have “very powerful reasoning capabilities,” its owner, Elon Musk, said on Thursday in a video appearance during the World Governments Summit.For now, the AI community will keep tinkering with what DeepSeek has to offer. That is, until the next breakthrough comes along.“I certainly predict that in the next 12 months, it’ll be supplanted by something else,” said Etzioni. “But it’s a very real advance.”",cnn,POSITIVE,0.9959985017776489
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/14/tech/openai-board-rejects-musk-purchase-offer/index.html,2025-02-14 19:00:00,OpenAI board rejects Elon Musk-led $97 billion purchase offer,"New York OpenAI’s board of directors has formally rejected a $97.4 billion bid by Elon Musk and other investors to purchase the company.“OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk’s latest attempt to disrupt his competition,” OpenAI Board Chair Bret Taylor said in a statement posted to X on Friday.The statement marks the latest twist in a long-running feud between OpenAI and Musk over the ChatGPT maker’s planned restructuring. OpenAI was founded — by a group that included Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — as a non-profit research lab with a for-profit entity, but it is aiming to restructure in a way that could make fundraising easier and increase returns for investors and employees.Musk has criticized that plan as an abdication of OpenAI’s non-profit mission, and on Monday, a Musk-led group of investors offered to buy the company to return it to an “open-source, safety-focused force.” The bid could have led to a monumental shake-up in the AI industry and made Musk, owner of OpenAI competitor xAI, an even more powerful force in tech.But OpenAI quickly rebuffed the offer, with Altman posting to X on Monday: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”Taylor, who also happened to lead the board of X (then Twitter) when Musk began his takeover bid for that company, said in his Friday statement on behalf of OpenAI’s board: “Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure (Artificial General Intelligence) benefits all of humanity.”Marc Toberoff, an attorney for the Musk-led investor group, said in a statement that the rejection was “no surprise” given Altman’s earlier statement, and disputed Altman’s claim that OpenAI is not for sale.However, he added the group was surprised to see the action coming from the board, “which has strict fiduciary duties to carefully consider the bid in good faith on behalf of the charity.”“They’re just selling it to themselves at a fraction of what Musk has offered,” Toberoff said. “Will someone please explain how that benefits ‘all of humanity?’”It’s not the first time Musk has tried to put up hurdles to OpenAI’s restructuring plan.Musk sued OpenAI in June 2024 but dropped that initial lawsuit after the company published a blog post that included several of Musk’s emails from OpenAI’s early days. The emails appeared to show Musk acknowledging the need for the company to make large sums of money to fund the computing resources needed to power its AI ambitions, which stood in contrast to the claims in his lawsuit that OpenAI was wrongly pursuing profit.Musk filed a new lawsuit in August 2024 and accused OpenAI of racing to develop powerful “artificial general intelligence” technology to “maximize profits.” Musk also accused the company of engaging in racketeering.OpenAI, meanwhile, has accused Musk of essentially being jealous that he was no longer involved in the startup, after he left OpenAI in 2018 following an unsuccessful bid to convince his fellow co-founders to let Tesla acquire it.In an interview with Bloomberg TV at the AI Summit in Paris on Tuesday, Altman said of Musk: “I wish he would just compete by building a better product.”CNN’s David Goldman contributed to this report.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.995934009552002
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/15/politics/questions-answered-trump-administration/index.html,2025-02-15 22:00:00,"Your questions about Trump 2.0, answered","A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.Washington When we asked you, readers of CNN.com and the What Matters newsletter, for your questions about the whirlwind of news that has been Trump 2.0, thousands rolled in.I’ve taken a sampling of the questions and either tried to answer them or gotten input from CNN reporters who cover these issues. I also used the first names and state of residence for people who provided them and did some light copy editing to the text of the questions.Many took the opportunity to criticize CNN for being too tough on President Donald Trump, while others said CNN was not tough enough. Perhaps that’s a good sign of objectivity, although those asking questions in the future could tone down some of the vitriol. A good number of responses were not fit to print.The most-asked question was what can be done if Trump refuses to comply with court orders.One questioner complained that his congressman would not get back to him. Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey also refused to answer questions for me.Want our reporters to answer a question? Ask it here.Why are Democrats so opposed to the Trump administration exposing waste and corruption and abuse? The Democrats are more concerned about protecting the bureaucracy instead of the taxpayers and citizens. AndyThis question was put to former Rep. Joe Crowley by CNN’s Laura Coates.CROWLEY: We’re all against waste, fraud and abuse. Nobody wants that. But at the same time … government is deliberative, government is slow.He added that there are questions about whether Trump and Elon Musk have actually exposed corruption or have just seen spending they disagree with and used that to fire workers.CROWLEY: They haven’t exposed any corruption. They haven’t exposed any abuse. All they’re doing is dismantling and destroying. They’re just taking it away and saying, well, we’ll find the abuse later, but first, we’re just going to get rid of everybody. And that to me is — it’s cynical. It’s — it’s incredibly sad. But it’s to that point, as I said before, we’re —everyone is against waste, foreign abuse. That’s not new.He said change should come in a bipartisan way and should not simply come from Trump.CROWLEY: It’s not going to happen overnight. You’re not a king. You’re not a dictator.If Trump totally ignores court orders, does the judiciary have any effective method of enforcement? I don’t know of any ‘constitutional’ police force to compel compliance with the articles of that document. Peter in MassachusettsCNN’s Devan Cole has written about what happens if Trump ignores the courts, as some Republicans have suggested he do, so I put this question to him.COLE: The simple answer is “not really.” Legal experts say there are few options for courts looking to force compliance with a pronouncement.Judges could hold an agency or official in civil or criminal contempt — but that’s about it. The most likely response by a court if the administration were to defy its edict would be to hold the agency acting in defiance of an order or ruling in civil contempt, which would allow a judge to levy fines on the government for its noncompliance.Criminal contempt would be a much more dramatic response by a court to such defiance. And it could prove to be a futile approach because it would need to be initiated by the Justice Department — meaning it’s highly unlikely given the president’s control over that department. The US Marshals Service, which enforces federal court orders, is also part of the Department of Justice.“The threat of sending somebody to jail is sort of a last resort,” said Carl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.The Supreme Court’s ‘get out of jail free card’ Trump decision wouldn’t protect him in the event of an impeachment, would it? SteveThis reader is referring to the special immunity the Supreme Court granted Trump (and all presidents) for most of their actions. Chief Justice John Roberts, in agreeing with Trump before his reelection that presidents should enjoy special immunity for nearly all of their activities while in office, argued they need “maximum ability to deal fearlessly and impartially,” with their duties.But in that decision Roberts rejected the idea that by escaping conviction in two impeachment trials during his first term, Trump could entirely escape accountability. Roberts distingushed between the criminal justice system and impeachment, which he described as a “political process” that is distinct from criminal law.That said, Trump is at the height of his power at the moment. It’s hard to envision the circumstances of his third impeachment in the current political environment.I’m a federal employee. Why won’t my congressman, Chris Smith, NJ 4th, respond to my queries about Trump’s ‘fork in the road’ program. The guy is impossible to reach. I’ve called his local NJ office, his DC office and contacted his office via email and can’t get an answer. It is an endless ‘do-loop.’ He is the longest sitting congressman and after 40 years in office he still doesn’t understand his responsibilities as a member of Congress. And I should note that Joint Base Dix-McGuire-Lakehurst is in his district and employs a lot of civil servants. Rob in New JerseyI called Smith’s office and emailed his press secretary twice. No response. According to the Congressional Research Service, using data from the Office of Personnel Management, the level of federal employment in New Jersey’s 4th congressional district is actually not that high. There are fewer than 6,000 federal workers in the district, which is about 1.5% of all employees there.Around 77,000 federal workers nationwide took the “Fork in the Road” deferred resignation offer. Now the Trump administration has moved to mass layoffs, firing thousands of probationary workers across the country as part of their effort to shrink the federal workforce.Exactly how far can Trump and/or Musk go into cutting Medicaid without congressional approval? I am in an assisted living center due to my health and cannot live on my own. The only way this is possible is through Medicaid. I am afraid that my services will be cut and I will be out in the cold with nowhere to go as I am not eligible for Medicare as of yet. Grace-Ann in OhioCNN’s Tami Luhby is the resident expert on Medicaid and she helped me with this response:Jointly funded by the federal government and states, Medicaid provides health insurance to more than 72 million lower-income Americans. It has long been a target of Republicans, and Musk has said “the big money fraud is happening” at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.How far Trump and Musk can go into cutting any funding approved by Congress will be a key question going forward. Trump wants to use the theory of “impoundment” to refuse to spend money Congress approves.But Grace-Ann should also be worried about the cost-cutting that congressional Republicans are discussing for Medicaid. House Republicans are looking to the program to save at least $880 billion over a decade to help pay for extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. A separate issue will be whether lawmakers will push for savings in Medicare, which provides health coverage to older Americans and adults with disabilities.Where do Trump and RFK stand on cannabis legalization or descheduling? Marc in New JerseyLaw enforcement agencies, under President Joe Biden, have already said that marijuana should be reclassified to a substance with medical value, but Trump could interrupt that process. Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said during confirmation hearings that the effects of marijuana should be studied.Trump nominated Virginia’s secretary of public safety, Terrance Cole, to lead the Drug Enforcement Agency. Cole opposes the legalization of marijuana.Trump said he would vote to legalize adult marijuana use in Florida in 2024. So did more than 55% of voters. But Republicans in the state raised the bar to 60% for such amendments to pass, so the minority was able to keep recreational marijuana illegal in Florida. It’s not clear how Trump will proceed as president.President Trump swore up and down that he didn’t sign off on Project 2025, but just about everything that’s been done since his Inauguration seems to be straight out of that document. Was he being deceptive in the run-up to the election? Chris in GeorgiaThat’s a value judgment each American will have to make. Trump said during the campaign that he hadn’t read Project 2025. That may be true. But many of the people working in his administration were involved in Project 2025 and his policies bear similarities to it.No one asked him to dismantle the government. We thought he would lower the prices of groceries and make life easier. - AnonymousTrump did talk frequently about slashing the size of government throughout the campaign. And many of his supporters are applauding his moves. He talked about attacking the bureaucracy, which he calls the deep state.True, he tried to distance himself from Project 2025, the conservative plan to redefine how the government works. But he still talked about ending certain government agencies, like the Department of Education. Musk, campaigning for Trump, also talked frequently about shrinking the size of government.This should not be a total shock, although it’s a much larger effort than many may have envisioned.Polling suggests there is general support for shrinking the size of government, although it will be interesting to see how the public reacts to the scale of the cuts.That said, Trump has certainly spent more energy so far as president on slashing government than on bringing down prices.If it’s now ‘okay’ to bribe foreign nationals when doing business, will it be acceptable for domestic and foreign interests to bribe US politicians and corporate figures? Just wondering, I may have plans to make. - AnonymousThis reader is referring to Trump’s order to halt enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a US law banning overseas business bribes. Trump does not have the power to repeal the law. He is saying he won’t enforce it, arguing American companies should not face prosecution for staying competitive and doing what companies from other countries do. Ethics experts generally disagree. Bribery within the US is also illegal and there’s no indication he will pause enforcement.Now that Trump has renamed the Gulf of Mexico, will he also be renaming Greenland to Red, White and Yellowland? TedThat’s funny! Although I think Ted should have said Blue and Yellowland. Since yellow and blue make green. Whatever.Perhaps the reader saw Rep. Earl “Buddy” Carter, of Georgia’s introduction of a bill in Congress to authorize Trump to negotiate to buy Greenland and rename it “Red, White, and Blueland.”It’s not funny that Trump’s White House has banned the Associated Press over that news agency’s refusal to use “Gulf of America” exclusively. It’s also no joke that Trump views his second term as a time for renewed US expansion. He wants to retake control of the Panama Canal. He wants to take control of Greenland. He is said to be serious about wanting to make Canada the 51st state. It’s also true that his bid to rename the Gulf of Mexico, along with his re-renaming military bases, are part of an effort to focus on his version of American dominance and history.Concerned Canadian for our American friends: Tariffs will undoubtedly cause prices to increase for everyone on both sides of the border. Why does President Trump want to cause economic hardship for everyone? His supporters are blindly following his statement that prices will rise before they get better. And the MAGA crowd accepts this? After Canada announces their retaliatory tariffs? Who benefits? - Francis in ManitobaI put this question to David Goldman, executive editor of CNN Business, who has written about Trump and tariffs. Here’s his answer:I don’t believe Trump wants to cause economic hardship — just the opposite. He has said that tariffs will raise revenue to support sweeping tax cuts that will help lower costs for Americans. Although Trump acknowledges prices could get higher in the near term, he believes inflation will be temporary and offset by lower energy costs and lower interest rates that his policies will bring into effect. But those are some big assumptions with many potential pitfalls. Like you noted, tariffs often invite retaliatory tariffs, which could ignite a full-blown trade war that makes prices even higher for Americans and hurts the economy.Mr. Trump was elected for the second time with his campaign promise that he would bring inflation and prices down including gas and grocery. When, exactly, will US consumers will see lower prices at gas stations and supermarkets? Please be specific. Thank you. - BibekanandHere’s more from Goldman at CNN Business:Trump has done very little to bring prices down. So I can’t tell you when prices will come down or even promise that they will. However, I actually think lowering inflation is one thing Trump has a well-constructed and well-articulated plan for. It’s not just “drill, baby, drill “— it’s tax cuts, DOGE, interest rates, tariffs and oil.Basically the plan boils down to this:1) Lower taxes within America’s borders, incentivizing companies to do business there.2) Raise taxes on businesses outside of America (that is, tariffs), bringing in revenue that will both pay for the lost proceeds from lower tax rates and drive more American manufacturing to grow the economy.3) Produce more oil to lower energy costs to defeat inflation.4) Cut spending, primarily via Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, to lower interest rates to reduce costs for businesses and consumers.There are countless potential problems with that logic — for example, most mainstream economists believe that tariffs will actually make prices higher, not lower, and the president can’t set interest rates on his own. But there is a plan in the works.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9965497255325317
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/17/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk-politics/index.html,2025-02-19 00:58:00,Are Elon Musk’s politics costing Tesla sales?,"New York Tesla sales are in an unprecedented slide. Competitors are rapidly gaining ground. There’s a lot of bad news for Tesla lately – but it’s unclear if the politics of its polarizing CEO, Elon Musk, are to blame.What is known is that Tesla had its first-ever drop in global sales last year, as sales fell 1% from 2023. That wouldn’t be a huge decline for many other companies, but it is notable at a company that had recorded 38% and 40% increases in sales the previous two years – and with the massive growth in its share price over the past decade largely predicated on future growth.On a smaller time scale, Tesla did report a sharp drop 16% in US sales between December and January, but that is typical for the company, which seems to make a major push for year-end sales to hit its full-year financial results target, followed by a drop in January. Sales in January 2024, for instance, were off 24% from its December 2023 sales.But Tesla is facing a lot more than a CEO whose eyes have not only been on the federal government, but at least four other companies he’s involved in. And that makes it hard to blame any one element definitively for the company’s relatively rough seas.“It’s still too early to see any (Musk backlash) in the Tesla numbers,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. “We can’t pinpoint that polarization is causing people to buy or avoid a Tesla.”Musk has become the focus of much attention for his moves to reshape the federal government as he co-hosts Oval Office press conferences with President Donald Trump. And the headwinds for Tesla sales are real, from increased competition to the price of its cars.Perhaps the biggest sign of shift in interest in owning a Telsa comes from S&P Global Mobility, which has sales data on a state-by-state basis. It broke the data into “blue states,” meaning states that voted for the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential elections, and “red states” where Republicans won four straight elections. And within each group of states, it looked at the percentage of household that already owned a Tesla that bought another one when purchasing a new car.In the blue states, the percentage of repeat Tesla buyers fell, from 72% in the last quarter of 2023 to 65% in the last quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, repeat Tesla buyers in red states edged up very slightly from 47.6% at the end of 2023 to 48.2% during the last three months of last year.The drop in loyalty rate for Tesla owners in blue states resulted in Tesla losing about 1 percentage point of market share overall in those states, which includes some of the nation’s biggest car markets, such as California.There’s some additional anecdotal evidence to suggest that some buyers may have been turned off by Musk’s political activism. Valdez Streaty points to polling of potential car buyers this month by Morning Consult that shows that nearly 32% of US buyers “would not consider” buying a Tesla. That’s up from 27% in a Morning Consult survey a year ago, and only 17% when it asked the question in in February 2021.By comparison, only 16% of potential buyers were almost certain or very likely to look at a Tesla before buying in the most recent survey, a figure that hasn’t changed much over the last four years.The rise in people who say they are crossing Tesla off their shopping list is not nearly as great as those now expressing a negative view of Musk. A January poll by Quinnipiac University found that 53% of voters disapprove of Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration, compared to 39% who approved. A poll in December 2022 by the university found 36% of voters had a positive opinion of Musk and 35% had a negative view.More used Teslas for saleOne factor that could indicate a Tesla-based Musk backlash would be the number of used Teslas hitting the market, as owners dump their cars. And there are more Teslas being traded in currently, with an average of around 11,300 Teslas listed on Cox’s AutoTrader, a record, throughout the fourth quarter of last year, up 28% from the average of 8,800 a year earlier.But even that has complicating factors – Cox said much of the flood of Teslas hitting used car lots is likely due to the post-pandemic surge in sales three years ago and the natural trend of some people trading in cars after three years.And there are many other factors likely driving down new Tesla sales, most notably increased competition. Legacy Western automakers such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen have spent the past few years rolling out new models of electric vehicles, with more constantly on the way and sometimes with lower prices than Tesla.By comparison, Tesla has made relatively modest changes to its main lineup – the Model Y and Model 3 sedans and Model X and Model Y SUVs. The one new model, the Cybertruck pickup, is an expensive niche vehicle that has had only modest sales.There is also significant new competition from Chinese automaker BYD, which has nearly caught Tesla in worldwide EV sales and actually topped it by a large margin in the fourth quarter of 2024. BYD is taking market share away from Tesla in China and Europe but it has yet to enter the US market.Tesla sales in Germany in January fell 59% compared to a year ago, according to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority. And just as Musk has been a key supporter of Trump, he has become a high profile supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.Car purchases are among the largest and most carefully thought out purchases that consumers make other than housing. And they generally look primarily at price, options and perceived value more than factors such as the politics of the CEO, said Ivan Drury, director of insights at car-buying site Edmunds.“There’s a huge swath of the populaton that doesn’t care about politics or it’s not top of mind,” said Drury. “A lot of people will put aside their feelings about politics when making a purchase like this and focus on price.”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9909013509750366
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/17/media/washington-post-anti-musk-advertising/index.html,2025-02-17 14:02:00,Washington Post opted not to publish anti-Musk ad campaign after initially being open,"The Washington Post scrapped an upcoming print ad from a pair of advocacy groups calling for the firing of Elon Musk as head of the Department of Government Efficiency.The nixed wrap ad — one of two ads purchased for $115,000 by Common Cause and the Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund that were slated to run on Tuesday — shows the White House superimposed over Musk with a bright red backdrop and the caption “Who’s running this country: Donald Trump or Elon Musk?” The wrap adds that Musk has “created chaos and confusion” and “is accountable to no one by himself.”“The Constitution only allows for one president at a time,” the wrap notes.The pair of ads are part of a petition from Common Cause and SPLC to “raise a massive public outcry demanding US lawmakers take action before more damage is done.” At the time of publication, the petition had 95,556 signatures.The ads come as President Trump has given Musk’s DOGE apparent free rein to bulldoze the federal workforce as the duo looks to slash the federal budget, though Trump insists Musk does nothing without his approval. Musk and his staff have been hampered to some degree by recent lawsuits, but the media mogul’s carte blanche has led to speculation that he is the real power behind the Resolute Desk.After sending the Post the artwork on February 11, Common Cause was told three days later that the Post would not be able to run the wrap, a spokesperson for the group told CNN. The advocacy groups had signed a contract with the Post and were waiting for a final review from the newspaper before sending over the funds.When the advocacy group asked the Jeff Bezos-owned outlet whether there was anything they could do to alter the wrap to make it more suitable, they were simply told that the Post could not run it.“When we asked questions, they said they couldn’t tell us, but they didn’t want to lose the whole commission, so they were wanting to run the interior ad,” the spokesperson said. “The interior ad was not a problem.”The second ad, which was slated to appear inside the paper’s physical Tuesday edition, echoes the wrap’s messaging, featuring a full-sized photo of Musk with the caption “no one elected Elon Musk to any office.” Though the Post was amenable to publishing the inside ad, Common Cause told the paper to forget it and walked away.The Post does not comment on internal decisions related to specific ad campaigns and declined to comment when asked whether Bezos was involved with the decision. However, the paper’s ad policy specifies that the paper “reserves the right to position, revise, or refuse to publish any advertisement for failure to comply with the guidelines set forth below, or for any other reason.”Virginia Kase Solomón, Common Cause’s president and chief executive, told CNN the Post’s decision was “concerning,” saying the paper — which uses the slogan “Democracy dies in the darkness” — “seems to have forgotten that democracy also dies when a free press operates from a place of fear or compliance.”“Yet now, we are forced to ask ourselves if The Washington Post — a pillar of investigative journalism during Watergate — is unwilling to challenge those in power,” Solomón said. “Under Jeff Bezos’ ownership, concerns about corporate influence over the press have only grown, and this decision raises serious questions about the paper’s independence.”“If even a media outlet of its stature bows to pressure, what hope is there for smaller, hometown newspapers,” Solomón added. “At a time when the free press is already under attack, we cannot allow political or corporate influences to dictate what stories get told.”The Post’s decision to cut the wrap, a premium and highly visible ad buy that covers a newspaper and immediately confronts readers, also comes as Trump has directed the White House to end subscriptions for media publishers whose coverage he dislikes, including Politico and the Associated Press. The White House’s grievance with the AP, which last week was exacerbated by the wire service’s refusal to call the “Gulf of Mexico” the “Gulf of America,” has also led to the publisher being indefinitely banned from the Oval Office and Air Force One, hindering its coverage.The provocative anti-Musk wrap would have been received by around 500 White House subscribers who have opted to receive wraps, a Common Cause spokesperson told CNN. Running the ad would have risked placing the paper — whose ailing finances were exacerbated in October when 250,000 Post readers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos’ decision to block the paper’s endorsement for Kamala Harris — directly in the administration’s crosshairs.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9983592629432678
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/17/politics/trump-putin-concessions-ukraine-analysis/index.html,2025-02-17 17:44:00,Trump offers key concessions to Putin ahead of Ukraine peace talks in Saudi Arabia,"Vladimir Putin is riding high ahead of critical US-Russia talks Tuesday in Saudi Arabia on ending the Ukraine war.Donald Trump’s administration has ended the Russian president’s international isolation, shattered Western unity on the conflict and cast doubt on how far the US would go to defend Europe, signaling a stunning shift toward Putin and away from America’s traditional allies.With a flurry of conflicting statements in their first forays into Europe, Trump aides also fueled concerns that the US president will embrace just about any deal with Putin — even if it’s a bad one for Ukraine and a continent whose borders are again threatened by Russian expansionism.Suggestions that the US will exclude its European friends from peace talks on Ukraine — despite demanding they provide security guarantees and troops as part of any deal to end the war — also triggered alarm in capitals on the continent, with France calling key leaders to an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday.Trump has also sparked fears that Ukraine itself would not be part of talks that are critical to its survival as a nation after its sovereign territory was invaded by a totalitarian neighbor bringing war crimes, civilian carnage and destruction on its people.The president on Sunday raised the prospect of a meeting with Putin “very soon.” He told reporters in Florida: “We’re moving along. We’re trying to get a peace with Russia, Ukraine, and we’re working very hard on it.”After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he would “never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine,” Trump gave a vague assurance that he would be “involved.”Rubio says the Saudi talks are a first stepSecretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will head the US delegation for talks hosted by the Saudis, who are friendly with both Moscow and the Trump team.Rubio styled the meeting as a follow-up to Trump’s phone call last week with Putin. “The next few weeks and days will determine whether it’s serious or not,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one.”Rubio also contradicted comments by Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, who said Saturday that while Kyiv would be involved in peace talks, European nations wouldn’t. “If it’s real negotiations — and we’re not there yet — but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they’re the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and they’ve contributed to this effort,” Rubio said.The evolving US line on the proposed peace deal shows that it’s often unwise to overreact to the early rhetoric of Trump and his subordinates before the substance of their positions is locked in. Without the new US president’s determination to forge ties with Putin, there’d be little hope of ending a vicious war in the coming months. And there still appears to be substantial room for Ukraine and European states to shape negotiations that can be fully successful only with their buy-in.Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said in Munich over the weekend that he thought Trump’s call with Putin was a mistake since it “vindicated” the Russian leader and lowered morale in Ukraine. But he added: “When President Trump says as part of a deal there will have to be European troops, we will have to be asked to supply them, so sooner or later we will have to be involved.”Still, mixed messages from the administration will fuel concerns that Trump will agree to a deal with Putin that validates the illegal invasion and will then impose it on Ukraine. While most foreign policy realists accept that Ukraine will not get back all the land seized by Russia, Trump was criticized for throwing away leverage with his call with the Russian leader. As was Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who said that a peace deal would not include a path to NATO membership for Ukraine and that no US peacekeeping troops would be involved. Some of those statements were later watered down by Hegseth and other administration officials.Concerns were exacerbated by Trump’s warp-speed attempt last week to fully rehabilitate Putin, an accused war criminal, when he promoted Russia’s foreign policy positions rather than the West’s. The president, for instance, seemed to sympathize with Putin’s rationales for the invasion and called for his return to the G8 grouping of industrialized nations after Russia was kicked out over the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Trump’s rejection of the previous administration’s lockstep coordination with Europe over Ukraine and the absence of Kyiv’s negotiators from the Saudi talks also appeared to seriously weaken the Western negotiating position. European officials are likely to be far more sympathetic to Ukraine’s views than Trump — and so if they are absent from any full-scale negotiations, Zelensky’s position could be severely diminished.A searing attack on European democracy by Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security conference — and his decision to meet the leader of the far-right anti-immigrant AfD party just days before the German election — meanwhile shook European leaders. The speech was a clear sign the Trump administration intends to promote many of the populist movements that are evoking dark echoes on a continent twice destroyed by war in the 20th century. And Hegseth’s blunt warning in Brussels last week that Europeans needed to “take ownership of conventional security on the continent” was widely seen as a sign of Trump’s antipathy for NATO and its security umbrella.All of this is music to Putin’s ears, since it suggests that his status as an international pariah is over, and that he has a deal within reach over Ukraine that would cement his territorial gains. The divisions Trump has opened inside NATO is delivering on one of Russia’s most important foreign policy goals.“It’s indeed like Easter, Hanukkah, Christmas, (the) birthday of Vladimir Putin and everything is happening in one day,” Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga on Sunday. “Whatever Champagne is not chilled is brought to the fridge and other bottles are uncorked.”France calls emergency meetingThe crisis in transatlantic relations prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to call an informal meeting Monday with the leaders of Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, as well as the heads of the European Council, the European Commission and NATO’s secretary general.While Trump’s hostility to 80 years of post-World War II security policy is a stunning shift in US policy and a sign of his antipathy to internationalist goals, Europe has left itself vulnerable to more isolationist currents in US policy that have long been part of America’s DNA.Years of strangled defense budgets have left most non-US NATO members poorly prepared for the task of defending Europe and the dominant role the Trump administration is now demanding. Swift increases in defense spending will mean painful choices for leaders who are already struggling to finance welfare states and are hampered by low-growth economies.But there are already some indications that the Trump administration’s hardline position is concentrating minds as leaders seek to impress the president. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who plans to meet with Trump in the coming days, said he’s willing to send British troops to Ukraine as part of any peace deal. Writing in Monday’s Daily Telegraph, Starmer also said European nations “must increase our defense spending and take on a greater role in NATO” — but added that US support would remain critical for guaranteeing peace.The talks in Saudi Arabia will also highlight another evolving theme in international relations — the growing clout of the kingdom — evidenced by both its growing role under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Middle East affairs but also by its soft-power initiatives like investments in European sports leagues and its hosting of the 2034 FIFA World Cup.Trump has made no secret of his admiration for strongmen leaders, and the prince and Putin have a tight relationship. A source close to the Saudi court told CNN’s Alex Marquardt that hosting the talks would enhance the Saudis’ image and prestige and show them to be players on one of the top issues of the day.Saudi Arabia will be vital to another of Trump’s foreign policy goals — ending the war in Gaza. The administration is trying to coax the Saudis and the Israelis toward a diplomatic normalization agreement that could reshape the geopolitics of the Middle East and solidify an Arab front against Iran. But such a deal would be politically impossible for the Saudis without a path to a state for the Palestinians. And Arab states have pushed back hard against Trump’s extraordinary plan to relocate Palestinians en masse out of Gaza in what would amount to a form of ethnic cleansing.Trump’s fantastical plan for the US to “own” and redevelop Gaza, as well as his apparent desire to enter talks with Putin on Ukraine, underscore the risks of his unorthodox approach to foreign relations. But the president is b﻿ack in the White House at a unique moment that offers opportunities to pursue agreements that could make America and the world safer — that is, unless he inks deals that ignore grave security implications.Sikorski warned in Munich that the president was playing for huge stakes.“The credibility of the United States depends on how this war (in Ukraine) ends — not just the Trump administration, but the United States itself.”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9844637513160706
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/17/politics/what-to-know-about-trumps-appeal-to-the-supreme-court/index.html,2025-02-18 21:54:00,What to know about Trump’s appeal to the Supreme Court,"President Donald Trump is heading to the Supreme Court for the first time in his second term, using an emergency appeal to call on the justices to let him fire the head of a government ethics watchdog agency.The case, Bessent v. Dellinger, could eventually help clarify whether Congress may create independent agencies that are protected from the whims of the White House, or whether presidents can fire anyone seen as a potential critic.It arrives at a moment when Trump is attempting to consolidate power within the federal government, summarily dismissing federal officials who might challenge him and attempting to freeze federal funding that Congress has required to be spent.Here’s a look at the case and why it matters:Who is Hampton Dellinger?At the center of the dispute is Hampton Dellinger, who President Joe Biden named in 2023 to lead the Office of Special Counsel for a five-year term. He was confirmed by the Senate early last year.The Office of Special Counsel – which is unrelated to special counsels like Jack Smith or Robert Mueller who are appointed to oversee politically sensitive Justice Department investigations – handles allegations of whistleblower retaliation and is an independent agency. Created during the Carter administration, Congress made clear the special counsel could be removed “by the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”The director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office fired Dellinger on February 7 in a brief email. The email cited none of those for-cause requirements that Congress required.“Rather than hamper the president’s substantive regulatory agenda, the OSC’s independence protects and assures whistleblowers,” Dellinger’s attorney said in a recent filing. “If the official charged with protecting whistleblowers from retaliation was himself utterly vulnerable to retaliation and removal for taking on politically charged or inconvenient cases, then the OSC’s whistleblower protection purpose might fail when it is most needed.”Why is Trump picking this fight?Dellinger’s case could have implications beyond just his office because Trump has fired other officials at independent agencies that have similar legal protections, including the former chair of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board. And many other independent agencies could be affected by the high court’s decisions, from the Federal Trade Commission to the Federal Reserve.Congress granted those boards independence so they could make decisions one step removed from the politics of the moment. During his first term, for instance, Trump repeatedly leaned on the Federal Reserve to set lower rates. The board largely ignored him. A lower rate can bump stock prices and make it cheaper for people to borrow money, often giving a boost to a president’s favorability. But lowering interest rates can also fuel higher inflation.The Office of Special Counsel investigates and prosecutes allegations of abuses of civil service law and serves as an independent entity where federal employees can blow a whistle on wrongdoing without facing reprisal from the political leaders of their agencies. The Merit Systems Protection Board can adjudicate those cases if an employee and government agencies cannot resolve a dispute on their own.While obscure outside the federal government, both boards could play a critical role in pumping the brakes on Trump’s efforts to massively reduce the size of the federal government.Trump’s supporters note he ran in part on shaking up – and cutting – the federal government. As the head of the executive branch, he has argued, he should be permitted to fire officials in the federal government at will.“This court should not allow lower courts to seize executive power by dictating to the president how long he must continue employing an agency head against his will,” Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris, who represents the Trump administration at the Supreme Court, told the justices in her emergency appeal this weekend.But Trump is also picking a side in a much broader legal dispute over whether a president should have complete control of the executive branch or whether Congress can set up independent federal agencies and shield them from political pressure. That fight has been waged for decades and several of the conservative justices on the Supreme Court have signaled for years they may agree with Trump’s underlying position.For-cause protections for federal officials have long been controversial. While President Jimmy Carter signed the law creating the special counsel, his own Justice Department originally questioned the constitutionality of those protections.Is there precedent for this?Dellinger’s case rests in part on a foundational 1935 precedent, Humphrey’s Executor v. US, that allows Congress to require presidents to show cause – such as malfeasance – before dismissing board members overseeing independent agencies.But the Supreme Court’s conservatives have distanced themselves from that decision in recent years, most notably in a 2020 decision involving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In that case, Seila Law v. CFPB, the court held that protections for the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau violated separation of powers principles. That controversial agency, originally envisioned by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, was created in response to the 2008 financial meltdown and it has approved consumer-friendly regulations on mortgages, car loans and credit cards.The president’s power to “remove – and thus supervise – those who wield executive power” flows directly from the Constitution, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.“The CFPB director has no boss, peers, or voters to report to,” Roberts wrote. “Yet the director wields vast rulemaking, enforcement, and adjudicatory authority over a significant portion of the US economy.”In a section that Dellinger has repeatedly noted in court filings, Roberts mentioned the Office of Special Counsel in his opinion and, importantly, appeared to distinguish it from the CFPB.The special counsel “exercises only limited jurisdiction to enforce certain rules governing federal government employers and employees,” Roberts wrote. “It does not bind private parties at all or wield regulatory authority comparable to the CFPB.”The court’s 5-4 decision left Humphrey’s in place, with Roberts noting that it applied only to independent agencies led a by a single director rather than multi-member boards. But some on the court have openly called for Humphrey’s demise.Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, described the 1935 precedent as a “direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people.”So, what happens next with Dellinger?It’s important to note that the emergency appeal over Dellinger’s removal is arriving at the Supreme Court in an emergency posture.Because of that, the court could resolve it quickly without saying much – or anything – about these bigger questions about the constitutionality of for-cause protections.In Dellinger’s case, a federal district court issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the Trump administration from enforcing the dismissal for a few weeks. Such temporary orders are, generally, not appealable.By appealing anyway, Trump is also picking a fight with the courts about their own procedures. Even if a majority of the Supreme Court ultimately sides with Trump in Dellinger’s case down the line, it may very well rule against the administration on procedural grounds in this first skirmish.In a 2-1 decision on Saturday night, the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit said the temporary order allowing Dellinger to remain in the post was not appealable. Reviewing such an order, the court said, “would be inconsistent with governing legal standards and ill-advised.”The two judges in the majority in that decision were appointed by Biden. A third judge, appointed by Trump, said he would have granted the government’s request to block the lower court ruling that temporarily paused Dellinger’s dismissal.If the Supreme Court agrees with the appeals court, a major question for legal observers is whether any of the justices will write opinions shedding light on their views about the merits of the case. Those opinions would provide clues about where the broader legal fight over Trump’s actions is headed.The court has requested a response from Dellinger by 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, a quick turnaround by comparison with other emergency appeals. Notably, the high court did not agree to issue an administrative stay while it considers the Trump administration’s appeal. Look for an order by the end of the week, or early next.Where’s Elon Musk in all of this?While Dellinger’s case is the first to arrive at the Supreme Court from Trump’s litigious second term, it will not be the last. Nor is it the highest profile legal brawl already working through federal courts.More than 60 lawsuits are already pending, including those challenging the president’s effort to wipe out birthright citizenship through an executive order and to freeze spending approved by Congress. Meanwhile, multiple lawsuits accuse the administration of violating privacy law and other protections in allegedly allowing affiliates of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to take control of highly restricted government IT systems.Many of those cases are likely to work their way up to the Supreme Court’s emergency docket in coming weeks. Though Trump named three members of the current conservative majority – Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – neither his nominees nor the court more broadly has consistently sided with Trump.CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald, Tierney Sneed and Bryan Mena contributed to this report.This story has been updated with additional developments.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9946006536483765

Its success has also brought optimism to China’s tech sector, which is still recovering after a severe regulatory crackdown lasting more than three years.That campaign was sparked in late 2020 after Ma blasted Chinese financial regulators and banks in a landmark speech. His blistering criticism set off the most widespread regulatory crackdown in the history of corporate China, which affected the fortunes of other tech giants including Tencent, ride-hailing Didi and food-delivery Meituan. Since then, Ma, the formerly outspoken founder, has largely vanished from public view.His high-profile attendance at the meeting with Xi suggests authorities are finally moving past its crackdown as concerns about his business empire have largely been resolved, according to Angela Huyue Zhang, a law professor at the University of Southern California who wrote a book about China’s regulation of tech firms.“With the domestic economy slowing and geopolitical pressures escalating, the government is making it clear that it values and relies on the private sector to drive innovation and stimulate growth,” she told CNN.The timing of this meeting is significant as it signals “renewed effort to support private enterprise, especially in the tech sector, and to restore entrepreneurial confidence,” she added.On Friday, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks key Chinese companies, rose to its highest-level since early 2022, after news about the upcoming symposium was first reported by Reuters. It was last trading about 1% lower on Monday.A powerful groupThe world’s second-largest economy is struggling against the backdrop of an increasingly hawkish international environment amid growing US-China trade tensions. Instead of a quick recovery after Beijing relaxed its stringent pandemic restrictions in late 2022, the economy has floundered, weighed down by its ailing property sector and low consumer confidence.Since then, the authorities have repeatedly sought to fire up the private sector, a group that has grown concerned about Beijing’s increasingly statist approach. Private businesses contribute more than 60% to China’s gross domestic product and over 80% of employment, despite being dwarfed by the state sector in size.Xi’s meeting with private entrepreneurs “clearly represents a major course correction” in China’s policies towards private businesses, Fred Hu, chairman of investment firm Primavera Capital, told Reuters.“The private sector, long the backbone of the Chinese economy and the most important growth engine, has been battered in recent years by mounting policy and regulatory uncertainties, with dire consequences to China’s economy, and worse, to its labor market with rising youth unemployment,” he said.China’s crackdown on private enterprise had wiped out more than $1 trillion in market value for many powerful Chinese companies and stoked fears about the future of innovation.In the summer of 2021, regulators announced curbs on the for-profit education industry and its food delivery sector. Even though the campaign appeared to have come to an end more than a year ago, some tycoons were still rattled and not expanding their businesses with their previous flourish.This story has been updated with additional information and context.",cnn,POSITIVE,0.9420267939567566
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/17/tech/meta-robot-glasses-facebook/index.html,2025-02-17 18:00:00,Meta keeps trying to invent the future. It hasn’t worked yet,"Facebook kickstarted the modern social media age in the early 2000s. But its parent company Meta’s ambitions to expand over the last decade haven’t had nearly the same success. It’s still apparently trying again anyway, with the latest big thing: humanoid robots.A new Meta team is working on robots capable of doing household tasks, Bloomberg reported Friday. But the broader goal, according to the report, is to create a platform that other companies can use to build their robots – a feat that would make Meta a critical part of the robotics industry.And Meta needs that kind of win. While its social media apps have proven to be wildly popular, it lost the race to control the devices you actually use those apps on – namely phones. Apple and Google quickly dominated the smartphone landscape in the early 2000s, leaving little room for anyone else, including Meta, to compete.Now, Meta is seemingly trying to make sure it doesn’t miss out again. Over the last half-decade, it’s made an aggressive push into artificial intelligence and the metaverse to get ahead of whatever the next big thing may be – and to escape Facebook’s shadow. An expansion into robotics would be a big step toward that goal.But the company will face competition. Tesla flaunted its humanoid Optimus robot at last year’s Cybercab launch event, and chipmaker Nvidia announced new AI tech designed to power robots at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.A Meta spokesperson did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.Waiting for the metaverse to happenMeta’s biggest effort to move beyond Facebook came in 2021 when it rebranded itself as Meta to orient the company around the “metaverse,” a broad term for digital communal spaces typically in virtual reality.It was a statement that Meta is far more than just a social media app, but a platform that would help define the next era of computing.A Meta sign is seen outside outside the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on October 29, 2021, after the rebranding. Nick Otto/Bloomberg/Getty Images“We are at the beginning of the next chapter for the internet, and it’s the next chapter for our company too,” the company said in its 2021 founder’s letter, signed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.Still, nearly half a decade later, the metaverse remains niche, unlike the ubiquitous smartphone.Just 7.7 million mixed reality headsets are expected to ship globally in 2025, according to market research firm the International Data Corporation (IDC), compared to the 331.7 million smartphones estimated to have shipped worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone. Still, Meta is by far the headset leader, with the IDC reporting that it accounts for nearly 71% of the market.Consumer flopsMeta’s previous efforts to branch out from social media didn’t resonate broadly with consumers.In 2013 it launched a Facebook-branded phone in partnership with Taiwanese tech company HTC, once a major player in the Android phone market. But shortly after its release, AT&T dropped the device’s price down to just $0.99 in what was an unmistakable sign of poor sales – and perhaps an indication that consumers didn’t want more Facebook on their phone other than in its app.Meta also tried to get in on the smart home business with a video calling device called the Meta Portal (initially Facebook Portal), which in launched in 2018 but has since been discontinued.A Meta Portal Go system is on display during a store preview in Burlingame, California, on May 4, 2022. Brittany Hosea-Small/ReutersA Meta employee poses with the company's Ray-Ban sunglasses at the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, on September 24, 2024. Manuel Orbegozo/ReutersBut Meta’s latest expansion into consumer hardware with its Ray-Ban smart glasses shows promise. Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica said in its 2024 earnings release on February 12 that it has sold two million pairs of the glasses since their 2023 debut.That number is small in the context of well-established devices like smartphones, and even in the world of virtual reality headsets. But smart glasses are still a very new category, leaving plenty of potential opportunity for Meta.That’s if it can fend off upcoming competition from Google and Samsung, which announced a new version of Android for mixed reality headsets and smart glasses in December, hoping to replicate the success they’ve experienced in the mobile industry.Meta’s ambitions with humanoid robots may be slightly different, according to Bloomberg’s report. While the company may consider making a Meta-branded home robot, the primary ambition would be to create a platform for robots – much like how Android is a platform that powers phones.It’s all part of Meta’s mission to make the name “Meta” mean something other than just social media apps.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.985193133354187
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/18/business/nike-skims-new-brand/index.html,2025-02-18 21:36:00,NikeSkims: Nike is in a slump. It’s hired Kim Kardashian to help,"New York Nike is in a slump. Sales are down, its stock has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past year and its new CEO needs some help turning around the aging athletic company. Enter Kim Kardashian.Nike is partnering with Kardashian for a new brand called “NikeSkims,” the company and fashion mogul jointly announced Tuesday. The collection, which is based on her popular shapewear line, “will disrupt the global fitness and activewear industry with best-in-class innovation in service of all women athletes,” according to a press release.Few details were initially made available, including pricing and images. However, the brand will first roll out in the United States this spring online and at “select retail locations,” with a global launch planned in 2026.The new collection is a first for Nike, which hasn’t partnered with an outside company before to create a new brand, rather relying on acquisitions or tapping popular athletes (i.e. Michael Jordan) for apparel. Financial terms of the brand wasn’t revealed.Nike said that Skims “proposed a shared product line,” but suggested “something even bigger,” thus the creation of NikeSkims. “More than a partnership, the new brand will set a new standard in the global fitness and activewear industry with an extensive line of training apparel, footwear and accessories,” the press release stated.The new brand will help Nike be more relevant in the activewear category, helping it compete against Lululemon and Alo, which is an area “where it has been flagging and playing second fiddle,” according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail.“In theory, Nike should have all the skills needed to drive its own brand in womenswear, but the reality is it has lost some of its ability to story tell, innovate and wow consumers,” Saunders told CNN. “Partnering with Skims remedies some of those weaknesses.”Skims has been a major success story for Kardashian with the privately held company valued at a whopping $4 billion as of July 2023.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/18/business/regional-jets-airline-flights/index.html,2025-02-18 14:41:00,Many passengers might prefer not to fly regional jets. But they have little choice,"New York Regional jets are despised by many passengers. They’re uncomfortable and cramped, with little space for both carry-on luggage and people. Although their use is on the decline, for many routes, there’s little choice but to fly them.The smaller jets have been getting attention due to two high-profile crashes in recent weeks – the Delta Air Lines-branded flight that flipped over and burst into flames Monday upon landing in Toronto, and the fatal collision of a US Army helicopter with an American Airlines-branded regional jet on approach at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport last month.Investigations into the causes of the two crashes are just beginning, so it’s too soon to say what was responsible. The crew in the Delta flight in Toronto got all 76 passengers out of the upside-down plane quickly and safely after the crash amid flames.A Delta airlines plane sits on its roof after crashing upon landing at Toronto Pearson Airport in Toronto, Ontario, on February 17. Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty ImagesEven before the crashes, smaller jets were not popular with passengers and airlines already know it. When United Airlines placed a large order of full-sized narrow-body jets from Boeing and Airbus in June 2021, United CEO Scott Kirby said a major reason for the purchase was to try to greatly reduce the use of regional jets, which he said “customers dislike.”But that doesn’t mean they’re inherently more dangerous than any other commercial jet.“The seats have less leg room, and there’s less recline. No question about that, it’s not as comfortable an environment,” airline consultant Mike Boyd told CNN on Tuesday. “But they’re going to be as safe as any larger airplane. And while some passengers might not like them, many people don’t notice. They get on them and go.”Regional jets are a large share of US flightsRegional jets are a significant part of the networks of three major US airlines – United, American and Delta. They are typically operated by a separate “feeder” airline company flying under the name of one of the major carriers. The staff of the feeder airlines are lower paid and get fewer benefits than the employees at mainline carriers, even when the feeder airline is a wholly owned subsidiary of the major airline, as is the case at Endeavor Air, the Delta subsidiary that was operating the flight that crashed in Toronto. Passengers booking flights might not notice they’re not on a jet operated by their named carrier unless they read the fine print.But they’re a significant part of the airborne ecosystem, making flights that the airlines have decided don’t make economic sense to serve with full-size jets. About 31% of all flights flown by US airlines were flown by regional carriers in 2023, down from 46% in 2014, according to the most recent data from the Regional Airlines Association. Because planes are smaller, however, they only make up about 14% of the number of seats flown, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.For many flyers, those seats are their only choice. About 67% of US airports are served only by regional airlines, according to the RAA, while its data shows the mainline operations of airlines using full-size jets only reach 37% of US airports. There are 18 states in which at least half of the air service is provided by regional carriers, according to RAA.And many of these flights are just as long, if not longer than flights flown by larger jets. About 13% of US regional jet flights this year will be over 1,000 miles, according to Cirium. The Wichita, Kansas-to-Washington, DC flight that crashed just before its scheduled landing had flown more than 1,100 miles, and the Minneapolis-to-Toronto flight that crashed Monday had flown 678 miles. There are regional flights from Houston to Portland, Maine, and from Minneapolis to San Francisco that are more than 1,500 miles.And while smaller jets are often used to connect smaller markets to larger ones, they’re also are used to connect major cities. More than 80% of flights between Boston and New York’s LaGuardia Airport are flown by regional jets, along with 71% of the flights between Los Angeles and San Jose and nearly half the flights between Boston and Washington.“If it’s 2 p.m. on a weekday afternoon and you don’t need 175 seats, you can put a 50-seater on one of those major routes,” Boyd said.Regional jets being parkedBut the economics of regional jets are changing. A shortage of pilots has led to sharp increase in wages at regional carriers, which have typically been considered entry-level jobs for pilots fresh out of flight school.“Regional airline pilot pay has gone up 500%,” said Kit Darby, a pilot career consultant. “Seven to eight years ago, starting pay was $25,000. Now it’s $125,000.”“When wages go up, you need as many people on the plane to cover the cost of the pilots,” Boyd said.That means many of the older regional jets have been parked, either because of a shortage of pilots or the significant operating costs. Darby said about 350 regional jets are currently parked and not in use.Boyd said that many of the older planes need a major overhaul of their engines and other equipment in order to keep operating. That can cost $1 million or more per aircraft, he said.“Those that are parked are most likely parked permanently,” he said. “If it’s a 50-seater, it’s not coming back. To bring them back into service costs a lot of money.”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9982349872589111
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/18/economy/doge-irs-data-tax-filers-risk/index.html,2025-02-19 00:21:00,DOGE’s request for IRS data systems access may pose risks to tax filers,"The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — the special entity created by President Donald Trump and run by Elon Musk to bring about greater “governmental efficiency and productivity” — has been pressing for authorized access to IRS data systems right in the middle of tax-filing season.The IRS, of course, has extensive and complex data systems containing highly sensitive personal and financial information on more than 100 million individual tax filers and businesses. Those systems are often interconnected, and making changes in one can have a knock-on effect on others, according to Terry Milholland, who served as IRS chief technology officer from 2008 to 2016.The mere fact that DOGE is seeking such quick access has been alarming to many people for a number of reasons — including the potential that DOGE team members may access some types of tax data illegally, even if inadvertently — or illegally expose that data to third parties. Additionally, neither lawmakers nor the public have been given any clear sense as to what DOGE’s plans are for using the data it does access. (Alarm is so great that a group of taxpayer advocates, small business groups and unions filed an emergency suit in federal court to “halt DOGE’s unfettered and lawless access to personal data at levels (that) endanger the privacy of hundreds of millions of Americans.”)On top of those serious concerns, DOGE most immediately may pose risks to Americans who are preparing to file their taxes now, as the group presses the IRS for access to its systems, noted John Koskinen, who served as IRS commissioner from late December 2013 to mid-November 2017.“They run the risk of inadvertently triggering errors and having the (tax-filing) system shut down,” Koskinen said. He noted that even the IRS typically doesn’t tinker with its systems during the filing season because everyone’s priority at the agency is to ensure a smooth experience. “I don’t see the urgency or the rush. The systems aren’t going anywhere.”And, he added, “I would think anyone with knowledge of IT and an understanding of the complexity of the tax filing season would stay away” — at least until early summer, when the bulk of the more than 140 million returns the IRS is expecting will have been filed.Potential problems that could hurt tax filersWith DOGE at the IRS, what might make it more difficult for a filer to get their refund in a timely way, look up their tax data online, upload a document or even file their return?Distractions: The mere presence of DOGE at the agency in the middle of tax-filing season is taking up the time and energy of IRS employees who otherwise should be fully focused on the smooth functioning of the systems for tax season, Koskinen said.Lack of sufficient training to use the systems: Whichever systems DOGE team members are hoping to navigate, it takes a fair amount of training to do so capably, said Mark Mazur, a former director at the IRS Office of Research, Analysis and Statistics and a former assistant secretary for tax policy at the US Treasury. “You’d need some IRS employees to help you, (especially) not to screw something up.”Misinterpretations and misguided orders: To the extent DOGE wants to root out what it assumes is waste, fraud and abuse, there’s a high risk that DOGE members may misinterpret the data they are viewing. Unless you have experience working with the data and understand the complexities of, say, a particular tax measure, it’s easy to misunderstand what the data you’re looking at represents, Mazur said.And, whether a DOGE team member manually tinkers with a given system or simply orders an IRS employee to stop a given function, there’s potential for system interruption.For instance, Mazur said, “Someone from DOGE might say this group getting a refund needs to be looked at more.” Or, he noted, someone might see a certain tax credit is being paid to a group of filers who don’t have Social Security numbers, and they may wrongly assume that’s fraud, even though there are circumstances in which the IRS assigns different IDs to filers who are eligible to claim a given benefit.Put simply: “They’re going to think they know what they’re doing and they won’t,” Mazur said.Navigating intricate systemsMilholland said he is not comfortable with the idea of an outside group like DOGE possibly making changes to systems they have no experience with.“You have to have deep knowledge of how the pieces fit together. It’s a well-honed machine designed years ago,” he said. “If DOGE wants to go in and make changes, God help us. If they want read-only access for political purposes — fine. But don’t give them write access.”In fact, Milholland noted, the IRS career employees who understand the systems best — and, in particular, the older programming languages still used to keep the data systems operating smoothly — are nearing retirement. If they decide they’ve had enough and leave early — or are pushed out prematurely through DOGE-ordered layoffs, “you don’t have people who can change this stuff,” he said.That worry also speaks to Mazur’s biggest concern with DOGE’s rushed push to get into the IRS systems.“One thing that sort of sums up my concerns is the Silicon Valley tech bro ethos of ‘move fast and break things.’ I am worried about the potential large-scale consequences if they break things like the IRS data systems or the federal government payment systems because these could affect large numbers of regular Americans,” he said.Particular to this tax-filing season, Koskinen notes that any mid-stream changes to data systems or potential IRS layoffs that materially may affect taxpayers’ filing experience will be noticed. “It runs the risk of making life very difficult for tax filers and tax preparers. Filers aren’t just Democrats. They’re Republicans and Independents. It makes absolutely no sense,” he said.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9753302931785583
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/18/food/coca-cola-simply-pop-launch/index.html,2025-02-18 20:00:00,Poppi and Olipop are the trendy new sodas. Coca-Cola is responding,"New York Poppi and Olipop, watch out: Coca-Cola is entering the “better for you” soda category with a response of its own.This month, the beverage behemoth is rolling out Simply Pop, a prebiotic-packed soda that is flavored with fruit juice and vitamins that it claims “supports gut health,” in response to the growing popularity and sales of its smaller rivals.“We saw the prebiotic soda space really emerging as an area of interest for consumers, and we were paying really close attention to it,” said Becca Kerr, CEO of Coca-Cola’s nutrition unit. “We think it’s a space that is a great consumer fit and also offers a lot of growth.”Adding Simply Pop is part of Coca-Cola’s manifesto of becoming a “total beverage company” beyond its regular stable of sodas, Kerr told CNN. Notably, the company has seen success with milk and protein shakes.Simply, which first started as an orange juice brand, has expanded into other fruit juices, mocktail mixes, canned cocktails and now sodas. Using the Simply name was based on consumer feedback and adoration for the 21-year-old brand.Coca-Cola is likely hoping the recognizable “Simply” brand will help the new soda quickly establish itself, against Poppi and Olipop, the two prebiotic-packed soda startups that have attracted a loyal fandom in their few short years of existence.“After watching from the sidelines, Coke clearly has determined that the gut soda segment has legs,” Duane Stanford, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, told CNN. “The Simply brand is a smart way to get into a fast-growing and premium soda segment that is attractive to young consumers and resonates on social media.”Simply Pop comes in five flavors, including fruit punch. The Coca-Cola CompanyAlthough the functional beverage space trails in sales compared to regular sodas, it’s growing at a faster pace. The category is projected to generate $2 billion in sales by 2029, according to Coca-Cola’s research.“There’s a role that functional beverages are playing in people’s lives,” Coca-Cola’s Kerr said. “It’s giving people more chances and to try different things at different times throughout the day.”Olipop is probably the biggest beneficiary of the wellness trend, with the soda brand announcing a $1.85 billion valuation last week. And for the first time since its 2018 launch, the brand turned a profit with last year’s sales surpassing $400 million — double compared to the year prior.Simply Pop is launching with five flavors: lime, pineapple mango, fruit punch, citrus punch, and strawberry. They will be available by the case on Amazon and sold in 12-ounce cans for $2.49 each at national grocery stores.Although Coca-Cola has a bigger retail footprint, marketing budget and distribution powers, the 133-year-old brand’s entrance into the space isn’t scaring Olipop CEO Ben Goodwin.“It’s a massive honor that the largest soda brand in the world has decided that the category I invented, and the Olipop team has brought to life, is a great place for them to seek growth,” he told CNN.",cnn,POSITIVE,0.9887176752090454
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/18/media/elon-musk-60-minutes-prison/index.html,2025-02-18 20:34:00,What Elon Musk’s dangerous war with ‘60 Minutes’ is really all about,"Elon Musk has no power to put anyone in jail, but his fantasy about a “long prison sentence” for “60 Minutes” reporters is dangerous nonetheless.If you want to know why, just ask Elon Musk.He has repeatedly (and correctly) posted that “free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy.” In fact, those were among his first words when he took control of Twitter, now X.Musk has described himself as a “free speech absolutist.” He has decried speech restrictions in other countries. Yet his recent statements about the American media contradict his self-image.In a few short weeks, Musk has become the most vicious media-basher of the Trump administration, sometimes going even further than President Trump has.He has attacked a Wall Street Journal journalist who broke news about a DOGE staffer’s racist and eugenic remarks, saying the journalist should be “fired immediately.” He has argued that taxpayer-funded media outlets like Radio Free Europe should be shut down, disparaging the workers as “radical left crazy people.” And he has pushed conspiracy theories about media outlets committing “crimes” without any specifics.Musk’s posts matter because he has the attention and affection of millions. When he makes statements that are antithetical to American values, some of his fans feel emboldened to do the same.Notably, though, when he assailed “60 Minutes” in an anti-democratic tirade Sunday night, scores of usually Musk-friendly followers replied to him with criticism, pointing out his past promotion of “free speech” and accusing him of hypocrisy.A representative for Musk did not respond to a request for comment.Musk vs. “60 Minutes”A production of CBS News, “60 Minutes” is the most-watched newsmagazine on American TV. Trump is currently suing CBS and its parent company Paramount Global over the program’s interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. Trump claims CBS doctored the interview to help Harris beat him in the election; CBS denies the charge, and legal experts interviewed by CNN say the suit is a frivolous attempt to intimidate the network and the wider news media.On Sunday night “60 Minutes” led off its broadcast with correspondent Scott Pelley’s report about Trump’s first four weeks, with a focus on USAID and the human impact of DOGE’s dismantling of the department.The newsmagazine said Musk and DOGE did not respond to requests for interviews.But after the report aired, Musk replied to a “60 Minutes” tweet, seemingly in a bid to discredit the reporting.“60 Minutes are the biggest liars in the world! They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election,” Musk wrote, alluding to that Harris interview. “They deserve a long prison sentence.”Musk didn’t back up his assertions. He can’t, because there is no evidence that CBS ran interference for Harris. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that CBS asked her tough questions; engaged in standard editing practices; and aired a hard-hitting interview.Musk has first-hand experience with “60 Minutes.” In a 2018 interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl, years before he actually acquired Twitter, Musk said “I use my tweets to express myself. Some people use their hair. I use Twitter.”So do many others – but Musk is now in a unique position, not only as the richest man in the world, but as a special government employee in the Trump administration.Musk vs. free speechBy positioning himself as Mr. Free Speech, but then proclaiming that disfavored journalists “deserve” to be jailed, Musk is lending credence to those who say he doesn’t truly care about democracy, he values only oligarchy.His prison post prompted Aaron Terr, director of public advocacy at The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, to write to Musk, “Throwing journalists in jail over their reporting is what authoritarian governments do in countries like China, Russia, and Iran. Here in the US, you’ll have to settle for using your enormous public platform to criticize the media. As you’ve been doing. You know, counterspeech.”This is not the first time Musk has encouraged prosecutions of people he dislikes. He has publicly hoped for criminal action against companies that “boycotted” X and asserted that a nonprofit group “should be prosecuted for interference in US elections by a foreign entity.”Those posts last year led to an initial round of criticism that he wasn’t living up to his “free speech absolutist” posture.President Trump and Vice President JD Vance have come under similar scrutiny. Last month Trump signed several executive orders policing language at the same time he signed one titled “Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship.”“Conservatives who just moments ago abhorred any form of censorship are now 100% chill with the government banning words,” USA Today national columnist Rex Huppke wrote last weekend.In a high-profile speech in Munich, Germany last week, Vance accused European allies of censoring free speech at roughly the same time the Trump administration was banning The Associated Press from attending Trump Q&As and photo ops.When progressive commentator Mehdi Hasan pointed this out on Monday, Vance replied on X; called Hasan a “dummy”; and said “I think there’s a difference between not giving a reporter a seat in the WH press briefing room and jailing people for dissenting views. The latter is a threat to free speech, the former is not. Hope that helps!”Hasan pointed out that Musk “just called for a ‘long prison sentence’ for CBS journalists, for edits he didn’t like. Did you not get the memo?” Vance did not engage further.A CBS spokesperson declined to comment on Musk’s provocation.Musk arguably gets a pass, much of the time, because he posts so darn much. On Monday he tweeted more than 94 times and retweeted others at least another 36 times.He posted until 4:15 a.m. in the morning and picked back up at 9:21 a.m., then went straight through until midnight. Among other topics, he made sweeping and unsupported claims about Social Security fraud; shared a post that baselessly accused actor Tom Hanks of committing crimes against children; and promoted his AI startup’s newest chatbot model.“Some of the things that I say will be incorrect,” Musk told reporters in the Oval Office last week. “We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we will fix the mistakes very quickly.”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.988118588924408

But they can be equipped with payloads to carry out precision strikes. The US regularly uses them to target suspected terrorists in Syria, Iraq and Somalia.Some current and former officials say designating cartels as terrorist groups could potentially lay the groundwork for direct US strikes against the cartels and their drug labs in Mexico.The CIA has flown surveillance drones to hunt cartels inside Mexico before, according to a former and a current US official, under at least one small program that partnered with Mexican authorities.But the more recent flights were communicated to Congress by the Trump administration using a particular notification reserved for new or updated covert programs that the CIA intends either to conceal or deny, a source familiar with the matter said — suggesting that the flights represent a distinct escalation. The notifications made no mention of Mexican partners, the source said.The CIA declined to comment specifically about the drone missions. But a spokesperson said that broadly “countering drug cartels in Mexico and regionally is a priority for CIA as a part of the Trump Administration’s broader efforts to end the grave threat from narco-trafficking. Director [John] Ratcliffe is determined to put CIA’s unique expertise to work against this multifaceted challenge.”A cartel scout looks through binoculars on the US-Mexico border in Sunland Park, New Mexico, on January 24. Justin Hamel/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe revelation that the CIA is flying drone missions over Mexico comes amid heightened tensions between the US and Mexican governments.The Mexican government is already fielding questions about why American military spy planes have flown missions near the border in recent weeks.In response to CNN’s reporting about the dramatic uptick in military spy planes flying near Mexico, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and other senior Mexican officials have emphasized in recent days the importance of sovereignty and that those spy plane flights are occurring in international airspace and over US territory.Defense Minister Ricardo Trevilla said that he was not previously aware of those spy plane flights.“We cannot rule out espionage because we do not know exactly what was done,” Trevilla said last week. “However, they did not violate national airspace.”The CIA’s MQ-9 missions, however, are being flown inside Mexican airspace. The Mexican government did not respond to requests for comment.On Friday, in response to a question about increased US overflights in international airspace, Sheinbaum said, “The important thing here, I think, in the declaration, which is what we have always proposed, is that they share information with the Government of Mexico.”Under longstanding bilateral agreements, the Drug Enforcement Administration and some other law enforcement agencies also routinely fly aircraft in Mexican airspace in cooperation with the Mexican government.The CIA does not publicly acknowledge the existence of its drone program, though Reaper drones can sometimes be heard from the ground, some sources noted.Shift in counter-terror assetsThe CIA drone flights, combined with the expected cartel designations, underscore how the Trump administration is working to shift a broad range of counterterrorism authorities and resources to counter-cartel work along the US-Mexico border and inside Mexico itself.Planning for that shift started even before Trump took office. A 30-page Trump transition planning document titled “2025 Agency Action Plan,” reviewed by CNN, outlined the Trump administration’s early priorities for the intelligence community to “reprogram [counterterrorism] resources.”“Treat counter-drug cartel work as a form of counter-terrorism and use those authorities and unique resources appropriately, including by moving resources from other regions if necessary,” the document directed.Mexican federal forces guard the perimeter of a scene following a shootout where several suspected gang members were killed while one local cartel leader was arrested on the outskirts of Culiacan, Sinaloa state, Mexico, on October 22, 2024. Jose Betanzos/ReutersTrump has mused publicly before about using military force against the cartels, including during his first term as President.In 2019, Trump said that the US was ready to “wage war” on the groups, tweeting that “the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army.” And while signing an executive order on January 20 that called for some to be designated foreign terrorist organizations, Trump was asked by reporters whether he would send special operations forces to Mexico.“Could happen,” Trump said. “Stranger things have happened.”Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz has also previously advocated for offensive action against Mexican drug cartels. As a member of Congress, in 2023, he co-introduced legislation creating an authorization for the use of military force against them.In response to the January 20 executive order, the State Department drafted a list of cartels that it believes should be designated foreign terrorist organizations, according to an official familiar with the matter. The formal designations have not been made yet, but the State Department sent a list of drug cartels to Congress last week that it is planning to designate, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.The list includes transnational gangs MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, as well as several cartels active in Mexico including the Sinaloa, Jalisco, Zetas and Gulf cartels, Cartel Unidos and La Nueva Familia Michoacana (LNFM).Extremist Islamist groups make up the vast majority of currently listed foreign terrorist organizations. Those groups differ from the cartels in key ways.Former officials and analysts say that, though they share some operational similarities, the cartels are essentially commercial organizations, not ideological ones; they are not interested in governing populations or seizing territory; and they in some cases are deeply entwined with parts of the Mexican government, which the US military actively partners with and supports on counter-narcotics initiatives.This story has been updated with new reporting.CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9918770790100098

Musk and DOGE’s access to closely guarded government data – including sensitive information it has collected about and from the American public – has become a battleground in the legal fight against the Trump administration’s efforts to reshape the federal bureaucracy.The attorneys general sued Musk last week, arguing that his role in the government is a violation of the Constitution’s Appointments Clause, which gives presidents the power to appoint officials who must then be confirmed by the Senate.The states had asked Chutkan to temporarily prohibit Musk and DOGE from accessing government information systems at the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Commerce.They also wanted the judge to block Musk and DOGE from firing or placing on involuntary leave any employees at those agencies.But Chutkan said that the states hadn’t shown “that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent a temporary restraining order.”“The court is aware that DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for Plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents,” she wrote in the 10-page ruling. “It remains ‘uncertain’ when and how the catalog of state programs that Plaintiffs identify will suffer.”Chutkan went on to say that even though the states’ larger case against Musk is “strong,” their arguments at this stage in the litigation were not good enough to satisfy the standard that must be met to warrant emergency action by the court.“Plaintiffs raise a colorable Appointments Clause claim with serious implications. Musk has not been nominated by the President nor confirmed by the U.S. Senate, as constitutionally required for officers who exercise ‘significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,’” she wrote. “But even a strong merits argument cannot secure a temporary restraining order at this juncture.”Chutkan, of the federal district court in Washington, DC, was appointed by President Barack Obama. She previously oversaw the January 6, 2021, criminal case against President Donald Trump.Warns DOJ to ‘make truthful representations’A fiery footnote from Chutkan highlighted seeming contradictions between those assertions and Trump’s executive orders creating DOGE, which connected DOGE to agency personnel decisions.“Defense counsel is reminded of their duty to make truthful representations to the court,” she wrote.Other pending lawsuits accuse the administration of violating privacy law and other protections in allegedly allowing affiliates of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to take control of highly restricted government IT systems.But the lawsuit from the attorneys general focuses on the constitutionality of Musk’s role in government. During the early stage of their case they sought to curtail his efforts to shrink federal agencies, which they said served critical functions for their residents.The states told the judge that the temporary restraining order was needed to maintain the “status quo that existed prior to DOGE’s creation with Mr. Musk at the helm – a normally functioning federal government led by individual officers at their respective agencies.”“Without a TRO, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm from the ongoing threats of disclosure of highly sensitive information and continued demolition of critical parts of federal agencies on which Plaintiffs depend,” the attorneys general wrote in court papers.CNN’s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that President Barack Obama appointed Judge Tanya Chutkan to the DC District Court.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9958947896957397
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/donald-trump-putin-ukraine-analysis/index.html,2025-02-20 00:48:00,Trump’s slam of Zelensky is a remarkable moment in US foreign policy,"President Donald Trump has now fully adopted Russia’s false propaganda on Ukraine, turning against a sovereign democracy that was invaded in favor of the invader.Trump’s furious attacks on President Volodymyr Zelensky come after he opened talks on ending the war but excluded the nation whose territory was seized by Russian President Vladimir Putin.On Tuesday, Trump wrongly accused Ukraine of starting the conflict and parroted another Moscow talking point in saying that the Ukrainian president should hold an election that was suspended because his country is in a state of war, under daily attack from Moscow’s forces.After Zelensky hit back, accusing him of being in a “disinformation space” Trump escalated the fight on Wednesday.In a post on his Truth Social network, Trump claimed that Zelensky “refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing former President Joe Biden “like a fiddle.” He went on “A Dictator without Elections, Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only ‘TRUMP,’ and the Trump Administration, can do.”Trump’s claim that Zelensky is a dictator plays into one of Moscow’s rationales for the war — that the elected Ukrainian leader was illegitimate and Russia’s long-term hope of replacing him with a pro-Moscow head of state.Trump’s turn against Ukraine is not just a remarkable spectacle as the United States changes sides in the middle of a war. It’s one example of Trump’s stunning transformation of US foreign policy as America becomes a nation that is rejecting the international system of alliances and friendships that it built to defend democracy and as its president seeks accommodation with authoritarians like Putin.Trump had opened the rift on Tuesday following a high-level US-Russia meeting in Saudi Arabia on ending the war.Zelensky pushed back Wednesday, accusing Trump of peddling Russian untruths and of rehabilitating Russia.“Unfortunately, President Trump — I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us — unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,” Zelensky said.“I would like Trump’s team to be more truthful, all of this doesn’t affect Ukraine in a positive way. They are letting Putin out of isolation, and I think Putin and Russian are really happy because they are involved in discussions, and yesterday there were signals that they are the victims. That is something new.”The US president’s embrace of America’s enemy Russia is worrying some Republican senators although there’s been no real institutional pushback against a position on Ukraine that is popular with Trump’s MAGA base.One of Trump’s top supporters, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, contradicted his frequent golf partner on Wednesday, although he walked a fine political line.”When it comes to blame for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I blame Putin above all others,” Graham wrote on X. But he also said that Biden and former President Barack Obama were “pathetically weak in handling Putin.” The South Carolina Republican added that Trump was the best hope to “end this war honorably and justly. I believe he will be successful, and he will achieve this goal in the Trump way.”Trump contradicts his secretary of stateThe US president’s comments will fuel fresh fears among European allies, which was also excluded from the US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, that Trump will try to impose a peace deal in Ukraine that favors his friend in the Kremlin.His remarks also appeared to directly contradict assurances by his own Secretary of State Marco Rubio after meeting the Russian delegation that any eventual peace agreement would be fair to all parties.French President Emmanuel Macron was on Wednesday hosting another meeting of European and other international nations over how to handle Trump, his opening to Putin and his attacks on Ukraine.This came a day after Trump launched his attempt to delegitimize Zelensky, who was on the phone call that led to the US president’s first impeachment in his first term.“We have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump also claimed that Zelensky’s approval rating was “at 4%” and “we have a country that has been blown to smithereens.”Reliable polling has been difficult in the middle of a war zone that has seen thousands of Ukrainians become internally displaced or flee the country. While recent surveys have shown Zelensky’s popularity dropping significantly from the almost universal approval he enjoyed at the start of the war, it’s nowhere near the depths cited by Trump. Some recent polls have him above 50% approval — which is comparable or better than the US president’s popularity.The president also warned that for Ukraine’s views on its fate to be considered, it should have an election, saying: “You know, they want a seat at the table, wouldn’t the people of Ukraine have to have a say, like it’s been a lot of times since we’ve had an election?”Apparently sensitive to criticism that he parrots Russian propaganda in his statements on the war, Trump insisted, “That’s not a Russia thing; that’s something that’s coming from me.”Ukraine’s last election was due to have taken place last April, but Zelensky said it wasn’t possible for voters to go to the polls in wartime — a position that is backed up by the country’s Constitution. Trump’s insistence on voters having their say in a democracy is ironic given his own refusal to listen to the verdict of Americans in the 2020 presidential election that he lost. And it’s even more brazen since Putin has stayed in power for over two decades by holding sham elections and imposing severe domestic repression.Trump tries to fog the cause of Ukraine warTrump’s latest attempt to curate American sentiment around Ukraine is similar to many of his previous efforts to fog the truth in an effort to create room for his political aspirations. The most prominent example of him doing was the 2020 election.At Mar-a-Lago, he also tried to reinvent the facts around Russia’s invasion three years ago, when Putin’s forces rolled across the border of an independent, sovereign democracy and redrew the map of Europe.“Today I heard, ‘Oh well, we weren’t invited,’” the president said, referring to Ukraine’s complaints that it’s not been allowed to take part in the nascent peace process. “Well, you been there for three years. You should’ve ended it after three years. You should’ve never started it. You could’ve made a deal,” he said.In essence, the president seems to be suggesting that the Ukrainians should have made an agreement with Russia to avoid the invasion — which, in practice, would have involved submitting to a puppet government in Kyiv loyal to Moscow or simply giving up fighting to hand a win to Putin.Trump’s response to the Saudi talks, which he said on Tuesday could be followed by an in-person meeting with Putin by the end of the month, risked redoubling what was already a victory for the Russian side. His comments are also likely to further cement opposition to his long-shot peace plans among Europeans, who his administration says must be responsible for enforcing any future agreement to stop the fighting.Trump seemed vague about what a peace deal in Ukraine would look like, underscoring impressions that his top goal is a deal of any kind, which would allow him to claim a personal political victory but that his critics fear could foster future conflict.He said Tuesday he’d be open to the possibility of European troops enforcing any eventual agreement – even though the idea was rejected by Moscow’s envoys at the Saudi Arabia talks. He didn’t comment on British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s warning that such a force would only be viable with a US “backstop.” This followed US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s warning last week that no American troops would be involved in keeping the peace in Ukraine. Starmer is due in Washington next week to meet the president and is presenting himself as a bridge between the US and Europe.But Trump’s enthusiasm for Putin is not shared by at least two senior Republican senators.Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker said Tuesday that he does not think the Russian leader can be trusted. The Mississippi senator told CNN’s Manu Raju that “Putin is a war criminal and should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed.”And Sen. John Kennedy agreed with his colleague’s acidic assessment of the Russian leader though stopped short of criticizing Trump’s approach to the peace talks. “Vladimir Putin has a black heart. He clearly has Stalin’s taste for blood,” the Louisiana senator said. Underscoring the party’s deference to Trump, however, he also rejected claims that the president had offered significant concessions to Russia simply by bringing it in from diplomatic isolation.“I haven’t seen us take any steps to take the pressure off Putin,” he said.This story has been updated with additional details.",cnn,POSITIVE,0.603142261505127
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/eric-adams-justice-department-hearing/index.html,2025-02-18 13:44:00,Eric Adams: Judge overseeing NYC mayor’s case to consider DOJ motion to dismiss on Wednesday,"The federal judge overseeing the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams has scheduled a hearing Wednesday to consider the Justice Department’s controversial motion to dismiss the charges.This will be the first public face-off since seven federal prosecutors, including the interim US attorney for the Southern District of New York, resigned in protest and four deputy mayors departed City Hall.The hearing comes as calls mount from top Democrats for the embattled Democratic mayor to step down or be removed from office and as former prosecutors urge the judge to not approve the dismissal without digging deeper into the circumstances surrounding the deal.A nonprofit group and three former US attorneys suggested, if necessary, the judge appoint a special prosecutor to continue the case.Judge Dale Ho, a Biden appointee, said the parties should be prepared to discuss the reason for the dismissal motion, what Adams has agreed to, and the next procedural steps in the case.“Courts rarely refuse to go along with a dismissal, but these are exceptional circumstances,” said David Sklansky, a Stanford University law professor and co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center.The Justice Department moved to dismiss the case under Rule 48(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which says the government may “with leave of the court” dismiss an indictment. Several judges have interpreted that to mean that judges play a role and are not a rubber stamp.In the past, judges have looked at a few factors, mainly whether dismissing the case is in the public interest.Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said the case should be dismissed without prejudice, meaning it could be revived, because of “appearances of impropriety and risks of interference with the 2025 elections in New York City” and because continuing the case would “interfere with the defendant’s ability to govern in New York City” and threaten President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Adams has consented in writing to the deal.Bove is expected to appear in court Wednesday for the 2 p.m. ET hearing.In her resignation letter, Danielle Sassoon, the interim US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the argument doesn’t pass muster because the arrangement “implicitly threatens” Adams with a future indictment if he doesn’t carry out Trump’s immigration agenda and is not in the public interest.Adams’ attorneys have adamantly denied that there is a quid pro quo.“At no time prior to, during, or after the meeting did we, Mayor Adams, or anyone else acting on behalf of Mayor Adams offer anything to the Department, or anyone else, in exchange for dismissal of the case. Nor did the Department, or anyone else, ever ask anything of us or the Mayor in exchange for dismissing the case. There was no quid pro quo. Period,” Alex Spiro and William Burck, attorneys for Adams, wrote in a letter to the judge Wednesday. Bove has also denied any deal.Comparisons to Michael Flynn caseThe legal drama has some similarities to former special counsel Robert Mueller’s case against Gen. Michael Flynn, who served early in Trump’s first administration and was prosecuted for lying to the FBI. Flynn pleaded guilty but later sought to withdraw the plea as the Justice Department, under Attorney General Bill Barr, then moved to dismiss the charges stating the evidence in the case was weak.Judge Emmet Sullivan appointed former Judge John Gleeson to review the case. Gleeson found the government’s reasoning was “not credible” and that “the Government has engaged in highly irregular conduct to benefit a political ally of the President.” He recommended the judge deny the motion to dismiss and sentence Flynn.While the case was being litigated Trump pardoned Flynn. Sullivan dismissed the motion to dismiss the case as moot but wrote, “As indicated by the history of Rule 48(a), the corrupt dismissal of politically well-connected individuals would also constitute an abuse of discretion.”If Judge Ho were to reject the motion to dismiss the case against Adams, there’s little precedent of what happens next.Adams is scheduled to go to trial on five criminal charges, including bribery, in April. He has pleaded not guilty.“We’re in waters that are so uncharted it’s a little hard to game out exactly what would happen if the government tells the judge, ‘Forget it. We’re not listening to you and we’re not doing this,’” said Sklansky. “You can’t order somebody to be zealous.”This story has been updated with additional developments.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.994843602180481

Critics warned at the time the ruling could have a chilling effect on infertility treatments and those who seek them. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, later signed a bill to provide civil and criminal immunity to providers and patients.Trump sought to distance himself from the ruling, insisting he “strongly” supports “the availability of IVF for couples” and called on Alabama lawmakers to “act quickly to find an immediate solution” to keep the procedure available in the state.While Trump pledged to make IVF more accessible last year, Republicans in Congress stopped short of guaranteeing nationwide access to the procedure.In June, Senate Republicans blocked a bill put forward by Democrats that would have done just that, criticizing the legislation as unnecessary and a political messaging vote. Republican lawmakers last year introduced their own bills on IVF and contraception, though none passed out of Congress.CNN’s Clare Foran and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9961703419685364

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston was briefly closed due to the “sudden dismissal of federal employees,” the library’s foundation said in a statement to CNN.“As the Foundation that supports the JFK Library, we are devastated by this news and will continue to support our colleagues and the Library,” the foundation added.A sign on the library’s doors read, “Due to the executive order, the JFK Library will be closed until further notice.” A source familiar with the matter told CNN that library staff who interacted with the public and fundraising were let go in line with the Trump administration’s effort to reduce the size of the federal government.The library will reopen at 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday, the National Archives said. A representative for the library directed a press inquiry on Wednesday morning to the archives.The closure came days after the government broadened its effort to cut federal workers, instructing agencies on a call to move forward with layoffs of probationary workers. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order last week directing federal agency heads to “undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force.”The National Archives did not respond to further questions about reduction in staff at the library. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Members of the Kennedy family called out the library’s closure Tuesday afternoon. Former Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, told CNN affiliate WBZ the closure was due to federal job cuts, adding that “when we start shutting down libraries in the name of government efficiency, we have got a problem.”“I would like to think that it was not a deliberate target at the Kennedy library, but I think what we’ve seen is that there is not exactly a whole lot of thought given to what are the consequences of these actions,” he said.Jack Schlossberg, a grandson of John F. Kennedy, criticized the closure, saying in an Instagram post that “it has nothing to do with government efficiency.”The library is one of 16 that make up the Presidential Library System and receives annual federal funding for maintenance and “a portion of its personnel costs,” according to its website.This story has been updated with additional developments.CNN’s Kerry Rubin and Shania Shelton contributed to this report.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9967362284660339

While Bove’s office insisted that it had, citing a Project Veritas video, Cheung and others didn’t believe the evidence on hand was enough for a grand jury investigation, her letter and additional sources told CNN.She said after the pushback, the Justice Department instead wanted to freeze assets in a bank related to the Biden-era EPA funding.The FBI in Washington was looped into DOJ’s plan, and sought legal backup from Cheung. The FBI ultimately wrote to the bank.Martin, however, criticized that the language in the letter wasn’t explicit enough about a criminal investigation.“When I explained that the quantum of evidence did not support that action, you stated that you believed that there was sufficient evidence,” Cheung wrote to Martin.“You also accused me about wasting five hours of the day ‘doing nothing’ except trying to get what the FBI and I wanted, but not what you wanted,” she added.Cheung made clear to Martin she believed there wasn’t enough probable cause to take the prosecutorial steps Martin demanded.“Because I believed that I lacked the legal authority to issue such a letter, I told you that I would not do so. You then asked for my resignation,” she wrote, noting the oath of office she took and an obligation to follow legal ethics and the law.Cheung’s departure revolves around the implementation of stopping some funding from the EPA to non-profit groups.The Trump administration has consistently criticized Biden’s spending on environmental programs. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin’s said he has had “found” $20 billion worth of funding from former President Joe Biden’s 2022 climate law in a Citibank account, and wanted to return the money to the US Treasury.The EPA then announced in a press release the EPA would “work with the US Department of Justice” on the matter. CNN has asked EPA for comment.Cheung didn’t respond to a request for comment from CNN Tuesday morning.In a statement to CNN, a Justice Department spokesperson said: “Refusing a basic request to pause an investigation so officials can examine the potential waste of government funds is not an act of heroism – just a failure to follow chain of command.”Zeldin has suggested the funding was rushed to eight non-profits to distribute at the end of the Biden administration through the Inflation Reduction Act, but a former EPA official responsible for implementing the funding told CNN last week it wasn’t rushed or set up nefariously.EPA had worked with the Treasury Department to set up a financial agent arrangement with Citibank to distribute funding to grantees; it’s the first time EPA has done this type of agreement, but it’s a longstanding process that Treasury has used for years.Zeldin has taken interest in a Project Veritas video where a Biden-era EPA employee discussed the administration’s climate funding, comparing it to tossing gold bars off the Titanic.Cheung sent a farewell message office-wide on Tuesday morning. She didn’t publicly indicate her reason for leaving.Cheung’s departure also comes at a time of roiling change across the DOJ, with prosecutors deemed to be untrustworthy being fired, and ethical clashes erupting between Trump’s hand-picked political appointees and long-time federal prosecutors.Bove last week presided over a public row with prosecutors in New York and Washington over his order to dismiss charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.Martin, taking the helm of the DC US Attorney’s Office, has supported unwinding all January 6 criminal cases that the office brought. He had enlisted Cheung and another career prosecutor in the office to look at how prosecutors charged January 6 rioters with a felony obstruction charge that the Supreme Court later overturned.“When I started as an AUSA, I took an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution, and I have executed this duty faithfully during my tenure, which has spanned through numerous Administrations,” Cheung wrote in her sign-off email to her colleagues. “I know that all of the AUSAs in the office continue to honor their oaths on a daily basis, just as I know that you have always conducted yourself with the utmost integrity.”CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report.This story has been updated with additional details.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9988301396369934

He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business before taking office and was the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.DeJoy developed a 10-year plan to modernize operations and stem losses. He previously said that postal customers should get used to “uncomfortable” rate hikes as the postal service seeks to stabilize its finances and become more self-sufficient.The plan calls for making the mail delivery system more efficient and less costly by consolidating mail processing centers. Critics, including members of Congress from several states, have said the first consolidations slowed service and that further consolidations could particularly hurt rural mail delivery.DeJoy has disputed that and told a US House subcommittee during a contentious September hearing that the Postal Service had embarked on long-overdue investments in “ratty” facilities and making other changes to create “a Postal Service for the future” that delivered mail more quickly.DeJoy also oversaw the postal service during two presidential elections that saw spikes in mail-in ballots.Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge limited one of the postal service’s cost-cutting practices after finding it contributed to delays in mail delivery. DeJoy had restricted overtime payments for postal workers and stopped the agency’s longtime practice of allowing late and extra truck deliveries in the summer of 2020. The moves reduced costs but meant some mail was left behind to be delivered the following day.DeJoy said in his letter that he was committed to being “as helpful as possible in facilitating a transition.”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9931830763816833

He returned to Mar-a-Lago about four hours later.Trump left the White House early Friday afternoon and is set to return Wednesday night after delivering a speech to an investment conference in Miami.No matter where they travel, all presidents are accompanied by the trappings of office, so Trump’s frequent visits to Florida are hardly unusual during his first month back in power. But his trip home stands in stark contrast to his strident view against remote work, which is a centerpiece of his efforts to reduce the size of the federal workforce.As he signed an executive order last week in the Oval Office, as mass layoffs were reported in agencies across the government, he made clear that he believes federal workers are scamming the system by working remotely.“There’s a whole big, oh, you can work from home,” Trump said. “Nobody’s going to work from a home. They’re going to be going out. They’re going to play tennis. They’re going to play golf. They’re going to do a lot of things. They’re not working.”When he is in Florida, Trump golfs nearly every day at the course he owns about a 10-minute drive from Mar-a-Lago. His presence at the course is so routine that supporters regularly gather outside the gates to welcome him. On Monday, he stopped briefly to wave after staffers from his club delivered hot dogs to supporters.In the first 29 days of his second term, Trump has spent at least 12 nights at home in Florida, most of them over the weekend. During his four years out of office, Trump frequently ridiculed Joe Biden for spending weekends at home in Delaware.“He went to Delaware and he’s laying on a beach, sleeping all day long,” Trump said last summer, mocking his rival. “Do you think President Xi of China is at a beach sleeping? Do you think Kim Jong Un is sleeping from North Korea with his nuclear weapons all over the place?”A White House official said Trump was not only playing golf on Tuesday, but also working from the club. He received updates from his foreign policy team after they met with Russian officials about the prospect of reaching a peace deal with Ukraine.The president is set to sign executive orders late Tuesday afternoon, the only official event of the day listed on his public calendar.This story has been updated with additional information.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.949108362197876

Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, specifically asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the Trump administration’s move to designate Musk and his associates as “special government employees,” noting the title does not afford them “carte blanche access to government data and servers.”“I also believe that Musk and his aides are subject to various conflict of interest statutes which prohibit federal employees from participating in matters that impact their own financial interests,” Murphy wrote in his letter to the comptroller general of the United States, Eugene Dodaro.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct a quote from an OPM email address.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9982374906539917

But the lawyer struggled at times to respond to those inquires, causing the judge to grow visibly frustrated.“How does this policy of ending ‘invented’ pronoun use (in the military) … relate to the purpose of military preparedness and unit cohesion?” Reyes asked at one point, borrowing language from the order.“I don’t have an answer to give, I’m sorry,” Justice Department attorney Jason Lynch replied.When Lynch conceded that no analysis was conducted in the days between Trump’s inauguration and the issuance of the order on how President Joe Biden’s policy of allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military affected national security the judge said that would factor into her review of it.The order, she said, “is not based on any analysis whatsoever … and that for sure is going to have to go into my animus analysis.”But the case doesn’t turn solely on whether the order is rife with animus. At a later point during the hearing, the judge told an attorney for the plaintiffs – several trans service members and two trans individuals hoping to join the military – that much of her arguments against the ban have “paid lip service to the deference I owe to the military.”The Trump administration is arguing that courts generally give significant deference to the Executive Branch’s decision-making on who to allow into the military.Earlier Tuesday, Lynch also dodged questions about the text of the order and its meaning, including its references to “ideology” and whether it actually called for a ban on trans service members.“The plain language of executive order actually says that being transgender is a gender identity and calls it an ideology,” Reyes said at one point. “Is being transgender an ideology?”“I don’t know the relevant definition of ideology in that sense,” Lynch replied.“You’re the government’s legal representative, right?” the judge said as she tried to get the attorney to reply to some of her questions. “I mean, I have no one else to ask, right?” “You’re the person I have to ask.”Lynch repeatedly disputed that Trump’s order is a ban on transgender service members – something the plaintiffs in the case have argued and that the judge appears to believe as well.“If we had President Trump here right now and asked him if this was a transgender ban what would he say?” Reyes asked.“I have no idea, your honor,” Lynch responded.“I do, because he calls it a transgender ban,” Reyes responded.Arguments over the constitutionality of the ban are set to continue Wednesday and an additional hearing in the case has been scheduled for early next month.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9983229041099548

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.Before President Donald Trump started mass layoffs of federal workers, he demonized them, arguing, despite evidence to the contrary, that most never went into the office.As he moved to cut foreign aid, he and Elon Musk alleged widespread waste and abuse, although they offered little evidence to back up their claims and may simply disagree with how the money was being spent.With that in mind, consider what the Trump administration is now doing to Social Security, seeding the idea, which is not backed up by known facts, that millions of dead people are collecting payments.Add in the departure of Michelle King, the acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration after a run-in with Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency over the agency’s recipient information, and it’s worth paying attention to what’s going on.Trump promised throughout the presidential campaign that Social Security payments and Medicare coverage would not be cut. But as Musk looks to slash across the government, he can’t help but look at the money Americans spend on the social safety net, just like a long line of fiscally minded lawmakers worried about the national debt.On X, Musk said he was “100% certain that the magnitude of the fraud in federal entitlements (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Welfare, Disability, etc) exceeds the combined sum of every private scam you’ve ever heard by FAR.”Musk also posted a photo of a chart – it’s not clear where it comes from – that appears to show that people hundreds of years old are drawing Social Security benefits.According to the Social Security database, these are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security 🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/ltb06VX98Z — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 17, 2025Trump later seemed to read from that chart during an appearance at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday.Appearing on Fox News Monday night, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt picked up the baton to suggest massive fraud that Trump has directed Musk to investigate.“They haven’t dug into the books yet, but they suspect that there are tens of millions of deceased people who are receiving fraudulent Social Security payments,” she said.Where is the evidence?There was no response to a request for more information from the Social Security Administration to explain what Musk is referring to or where the chart he shared comes from.Until they provide some evidence that there are tens of millions of fraudulent claims going to dead people, let’s look at the large amount of evidence that there are not tens of millions of such claims.Less than 1% in improper payments. Still too muchWhich is not to say there is no fraud in Social Security. There is. And when an agency pays out more than $1 trillion in benefits each year to more than 70 million Americans, a rounding error is real money. Social Security acknowledges paying less than 1% of benefits improperly, most of it in overpayments. That’s according to a 2024 report by the Social Security inspector general. Trump fired IGs at multiple agencies when he took office, including the person who at that time was the acting inspector general of the Social Security Administration.In January, just before Trump took office, the Treasury Department announced it had recovered $31 million in payments to deceased individuals over a five-month period, by using data from Social Security’s master file of hundreds of millions of deceased individuals, which is distinct from its payment information.“These results are just the tip of the iceberg,” said then-Treasury official Assistant Secretary David Lebryk, who later resigned after his own run-in with DOGE officials over access to the Treasury Department payment system.How many 100-year-olds are getting Social Security? Fewer than 100,000So there’s more to do here, clearly. Over the course of the past 10 years there have been multiple reports looking at the millions of Social Security numbers associated with birthdays that occurred more than 100 years ago. But there’s no evidence of tens of millions of people over the age of 100 being paid benefits.In fact, the Social Security Administration does keep up to date on who it is paying, and according to the most recent data, the number of beneficiaries 99 or older was less than 90,000 in this country of more than 330 million. But that’s in line with the 101,000 Americans who are 100 or older, according to Pew.“There is not like a zombie apocalypse of people, you know, cadavers running around with social security checks coming out of their pockets,” the former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O’Malley said on CNN. More frequently, he said, the agency has to restart payments after they are erroneously shut off.The facts are scary enough without inventing allegations of fraudTrump has promised to exempt Social Security benefits from income taxes, which would cost the program $2.3 trillion over a decade. The program is already on shaky financial footing as the nation ages. Trump has not said how he would replace those lost revenues if he is able to enact that new tax cut.Budget hawks would argue that Social Security is an untenable scheme since it requires more new people to keep paying into the system, a reality that runs counter to falling birthrates and Trump’s effort to restrict immigration. Americans have about 10 years to fix Social Security. Even before Trump’s tax cut proposal, the current guess is that Social Security won’t be able to pay full benefits as soon as 2035 without action by Congress.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9978862404823303
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/trump-putin-deal-ukraine-analysis/index.html,2025-02-18 21:17:00,Trump’s rush for a deal with Putin leaves Ukraine and Europe scrambling,"A dangerous fault line is opening as Donald Trump rushes to end the war in Ukraine.The US president craves an early political triumph to fuel his claims to a Nobel Peace Prize. But an equitable end to the conflict may defy a quick fix since it poses existential issues for Ukraine and European security.This tension was exacerbated by the president’s decision to exclude officials from Kyiv and European powers from US-Russia talks that took place in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. The meeting lasted more than four hours and was described by a member of Moscow’s negotiating team as “positive.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio said a framework had been established to explore a peace deal and to more broadly improve US-Russia relations.“The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that’s fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,” Rubio said.The fate of Trump’s push to end the war will ultimately rest on whether his swift pace can accommodate critical details of a peace that allows Ukraine to survive, secures the borders and security of Europe and avoids rewarding Russia’s illegal invasion.Trump has shown little obvious concern for any of these three goals – one reason why his strategy is a gamble.But each party in the process has grave concerns and significant leverage, which explains why ending the war will be far harder than his failed campaign trail promises to forge peace in 24 hours.Trump wants a deal – perhaps any dealThe war often seems a distraction from what Trump really wants – the chance to sit down with Putin, one of the global strongmen he admires.Still, there’s a chance that Trump’s urgency and power, plus that channel with the Russian leader, could change the dynamics of this World War I-style war of attrition.“In just a few months, President Trump has shifted the entire global conversation from not if the war is going to end, but just how it’s going to end. Only President Trump can do that,” Rubio said after talks with Russian officials in Riyadh.Trump is, for instance, only voicing a reality that many US and European officials have shared privately for months: that Ukraine can no longer win the war and eject Russia from all the territory it has seized.Trump’s subordinates endlessly laud him as the world’s greatest dealmaker. But his efforts so far seem naive.He’s conceded some of Russia’s top goals, often seems to empathize with the goals of the invasion and has turned on America’s European friends who’ve shared the cost of supporting Ukraine’s war effort. Those are the same allies who Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says must police any peace alone.In his most extraordinary move, Trump tried to claim half of Ukraine’s rare earth metals wealth — in a play that exploited an invaded nation’s desperate vulnerability. President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the “deal.”Trump appears to have little understanding of the historical hazards either in Ukraine or indeed in the Middle East, given his plan to move the Palestinians from Gaza so he can build beach resorts.Trump’s view of every geopolitical crisis as a real estate deal waiting to be clinched suggests he might embrace an agreement that lets Putin keep all of the land he’s stolen just to stop the killing.And there’s a big risk he’s being played by Putin. The Russian leader warmed the atmosphere ahead of the Saudi talks by handing Trump victories with the release of several US prisoners, including on Monday with Kalob Byers, 28, who was arrested on drug smuggling charges last week.And Trump thinks he came away from his call with the Russian leader last week with a pledge to talk sweeping nuclear arms cuts. This is one reason why the Saudi talks involving Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz are so important: They must test Russia’s seriousness and protect Trump from overzealous interpretations of Russian concessions.The stakes are huge. A hurried peace deal that strengthens Russia and weakens European security by validating Putin’s expansionism would likely sow the seeds for an even worse future war.At the end of the Cold War, President George H.W. Bush managed the fall of the Soviet Union and its satellite states in Eastern Europe — sometimes overruling regional leaders in the wider interests of the West and their own security. There’s no sign that Trump feels any such affinity for Europe or its future.Can Ukraine save itself?While Trump craves political glory, Zelensky is fighting for something far more profound: his country’s survival, now and as a future viable, independent sovereign state. Trump’s decision to open talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday without Ukraine raised fears he’s targeting a quick agreement with Putin that he’d then impose on Kyiv.Zelensky warned last week at the Munich Security Conference that he would “never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement.” But if Trump walks away, Zelensky would have to decide whether to fight on without US arms and ammunition and to rely on Europe’s lesser punch.Zelensky understands that he can’t count on US support with Trump in the White House and said last week it was time to form a European army because, “the old days are over when America supported Europe just because it always had.”Trump has given few signs that he’s got Ukraine’s interests at heart. Last week, for instance, he echoed one of Putin’s rationales for the war, saying that Ukraine’s NATO aspirations helped trigger Russia’s invasion.This new US empathy with the invader, rather than the invaded party, is why Europe’s participation in peace talks is necessary to even the playing field. But Trump is already looking beyond Zelensky, who was the recipient of the telephone call that led to Trump’s first impeachment in his first term. He said last week that Ukraine needs elections “at some point” after a peace deal and archly noted that Zelensky’s poll numbers were “not great.” This is another Russian talking point that Trump has picked up — even though the idea that Putin, who sustains his long rule with sham elections, has any credibility in talking about elections is absurd.Russia is relishing the sudden openingTrump said on Sunday that he’s convinced after his phone call with Putin that the Russian leader wants to end the war. “I think he wants to stop fighting. I see that. We spoke long and hard,” the US president said.But strategically, Putin may have reasons to keep fighting. Despite horrendous losses, his forces are making grinding progress on the blood-soaked battlefield.The Russian president has already achieved some of his goals before sitting down with Trump. The US president has shattered Putin’s status as a pariah in the West by speaking enthusiastically about the possibility of summits in both the US and Russia. And by ruling out a path to NATO membership for Ukraine and the deployment of any US troops to keep an eventual peace, the Trump administration has given up key potential sources of leverage.Putin might have failed in his bid to capture all of Ukraine, to take Kyiv and to replace Zelensky with a pro-Moscow leader. But he’s carved off a big chunk of territory in the southeast that he can use to protect Crimea and that offers a long shoreline along the strategically vital Black Sea coast.Russia must now calculate whether its potential payoff for handing Trump a huge win with a peace deal will outweigh the benefits of continuing to fight. The lifting of US and European sanctions, for example, would free the Russian economy, and Trump is already demanding that Putin be readmitted to the Group of Eight industrialized nations.Most scenarios for ending the war envisage a hard border between eastern and western Ukraine — reminiscent of communist East Germany and West Germany that emerged from World War II.History suggests that Putin would use such territory to replenish his military for a possible future resumption of hostilities or to destabilize the rest of Ukraine with the hope of eventually getting a sympathetic government in Kyiv.He’s long assessed he could wait out the West on Ukraine. His bet now seems likely to pay off as he seeks to to reconstitute the historic Russian empire and Moscow’s regional sphere of influence.Putin is playing a far longer game than America’s lame duck president who’s desperate for a quick deal.Europe scrambles to find a role in its own backyardUntil a few weeks ago, some European diplomats and foreign policy opinion formers were suggesting that alarm over Trump’s reelection was overblown, and that the new president’s volatility could be handled.So, the hostility of Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance in Europe last week was a rude awakening. As was Trump’s shattering of Western unity over Ukraine by sending his team to discuss peace with Putin’s team before consulting Europe.In retrospect, it’s baffling why European governments were so surprised. Trump is only doing what he said he’d do on the campaign trail. Their misreading of the US president led to the embarrassing spectacle of key leaders rushing to Paris for emergency talks on Monday to work out how to respond to being cut out of the game.The outcome of the Ukrainian war is almost as vital for Europe as it is for Ukraine. A peace deal that strengthens Russia would leave the continent facing an emboldened enemy just as the US threatens to walk away from 80 years of security guarantees to its allies.Europe’s severely depleted armed forces after years of budget cuts makes it doubtful it can sustain a meaningful peace force in Ukraine after any peace agreement.And new promises of surged defense spending could take years to fill the gaps and will be a heavy political lift that will require cuts in social spending.But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned after the Paris talks on Monday that Europe faced a “once in a generation moment.” In another sign that Europeans are trying to get their act together, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, wrote on X that Ukraine deserves “peace through strength,” echoing Trump’s new buzzword for his “America First” foreign policy.Starmer offered to send UK troops to help monitor any peace deal in Ukraine as part of an international force, but with one important caveat — that there’s a US “backstop” since such a guarantee would be the only way to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine again.His comment showed that European leaders understand that they’d be exposing their troops without US support and could risk getting into a war with Russia themselves.Starmer, who plans to meet Trump in Washington next week, is offering himself as a bridge between European powers and the US president, while trying to repair Britain’s global clout that has waned since it left the European Union.There are just two problems: Trump doesn’t seem interested in a bridge. And there’s little sign he really cares what the Europeans think.This story has been updated with additional developments.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.8745937347412109

This is an unprecedented attack on immigrant children,” said Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu, Florence Project deputy director, in a statement.The stop-work order is unlikely to affect children who are already represented, but the abrupt cutting off of funding could force groups to downsize or close entirely.Days after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, the Justice Department similarly told legal service providers to stop work intended to help support immigrants, stripping away critical access for people in detention trying to navigate the tangled US immigration system. That order was later rescinded without explanation.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.998363196849823

The company also described the tool’s new features, such as advanced web searching with “deep search,” the ability to code online games and a “big brain” mode to reason through more complex problems.Grok 3 is immediately available to members of X’s $40 per month “Premium+” subscription plans, or users who subscribe directly on Grok’s standalone app or website.The xAI announcement comes as competition in AI continues to ramp up, with big tech players racing to invest in bigger, stronger data centers to fuel more powerful AI models. Tech giants believe AI is on its way to revolutionizing how people work, communicate and navigate the internet, including by replacing traditional search engines and coding processes.American tech firms are now also up against a new kind of competition from DeepSeek, the Chinese startup whose recently launched R1 model raised big questions about Silicon Valley’s AI infrastructure investments because it suggested that advanced models could be trained more efficiently. Musk said Grok 3 was built with 10 times the computer power of xAI’s previous model, Grok 2, after the company opened a new data center in Tennessee last year.The billionaire referred to Grok 3 as “kind of a beta” test for now. “Expect some imperfections at first, but we’ll improve it rapidly,” he said.Musk also teased a “voice mode” for Grok 3 — similar to the natural conversation feature on competitor apps including ChatGPT — that he said would roll out in the coming days.At the same time, Musk, who has also taken on a key role reshaping the federal government as a “special government employee” under President Donald Trump, has sought to grow his influence in the AI space.Musk last week led a group of investors offering to buy OpenAI for $97 billion, the latest move in his ongoing rivalry with the ChatGPT parent company’s CEO Sam Altman, which the rival company’s board rejected. Musk has accused OpenAI of abandoning its mission to help humanity because it plans to transition away from its non-profit structure. The billionaire has also urged OpenAI to open-source more of its technology.Asked on Monday about open-sourcing xAI’s own models, Musk said the startup would make the code behind its previous Grok 2 model publicly available when Grok 3 is “mature and stable” in the coming months.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.983693540096283
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/18/tech/internet-archives-deleted-websites-wayback-machine/index.html,2025-02-18 17:00:00,The ‘Wayback Machine’ is preserving the websites Trump’s White House took down,"The White House has ordered thousands of government web pages to be taken down over the past month, leaving virtually no trace of some federal agencies’ policies regarding critical topics such as sexual orientation, January 6 cases and discrimination.Since President Donald Trump’s second inauguration, the government’s mass removal of data and policies it finds objectionable has illustrated just how quickly data can disappear from the internet, and it has sparked renewed interest in preserving information online among digital archivists.Thousands of pages from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website were taken down in January to comply with Trump’s executive orders, although some of the pages are back online following an order from a federal judge. Other taken-down sites include Justice Department web pages related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol breach; information about care for transgender patients on Healthcare.gov, a gender diversity page on the TSA’s website, and sexual orientation and general identity discrimination pages on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Census Bureau’s websites, as well as many others across the government.While it is not uncommon for presidential administrations to delete or change government web pages, the second Trump administration seems to have taken down more content than usual, according to Mark Graham, the director of the Wayback Machine.The Wayback Machine, which the nonprofit Internet Archive operates, is a tool designed to help with preserving online data, and it has been used in the past when new presidents’ administrations took down information from past administrations. The site allows users to enter a URL and, if the page has been archived, see what it looked like in the past, dating back to the database’s founding in 1996.“I think that many have reported that the scope of what we’re seeing this time – with regard to certain websites being taken offline, certain material on web pages being removed – is greater than it has been in past changes of administration,” said Graham.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.“Whenever there’s a change in office – regardless of which parties or administrations are outgoing and incoming – it’s really important that we preserve government websites and information as a record,” said Rebecca Frank, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s School of Information. “And while there’s perhaps a greater sense of urgency at the moment, the work that’s happening is not brand new.”Travel back in time on the internet with the help of archivesAfter entering a URL into the Wayback Machine, a user can see all the times the archive’s crawlers have saved the site and can then choose a timestamp to visit.The crawlers – computer programs, not insects – scour the web to collect data and save web pages. Users can also manually preserve a page by entering a URL on the Save Page Now section of the Wayback Machine site. The database contains more than 916 billion web pages, according to the site’s homepage.The Internet Archive, in collaboration with partners such as the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) and Stanford University Libraries, also offers the End of Term archive, which compiles and saves content from government sources at the end of every presidential term, dating back to 2008.There are also many other archival sites, including several that specifically focus on government data preservation.“Preserving digital information is a challenge,” said Frank. “It requires active work, both to make the decision to preserve it, to capture it, and then to keep that information findable, accessible and usable over the long term.”On February 6, the Harvard Law Library Innovation Center released an archive of data.gov, the government site that provides research data to the public, containing datasets from 2024 and 2025. The organization has previously released other archival tools, such as Perma.CC, which allows users to create permanent URLs of a site they wish to archive.“We’ve built this project on our long-standing commitment to preserving government records and making public information available to everyone,” the lab wrote in a blog post.EDGI has also been working to preserve government data online. Soon after Trump’s inauguration, his administration took down a digital tool that showed which places in the US face a disproportionate level of pollution. EDGI and other members of the Public Environmental Data Partners coalition uploaded a copy of the tool using data the groups had archived. Gretchen Gehrke, a co-founder of EDGI, said in a statement that its coalition is “mobilizing resources to archive critical federal data.”Online content is especially vulnerable to being lost to historyPhysical materials are relatively easy to preserve. Books, for example, are printed in many copies. And once they are printed, the content inside cannot easily be altered.Information on the internet, however, is much easier to lose. Content on a web page can be changed in inconspicuous ways, or pages can be taken down altogether.Additionally, the internet is based around the URL, a resource that only provides the location of information – not the information itself.“It’s like, you know your house address,” Graham explained. “But wait, 10 years ago, someone else lived there. How would you know that? All you know is the house address.”While independent archives like the Wayback Machine can help preserve otherwise-inaccessible pages, Johnny Hadlock, executive director of the National Association of Government Archives & Records Administrators, said in a statement that “government agencies must proactively incorporate archiving into their workflows to protect their online presence.”A report from Pew Research released last May found that 38% of webpages available to view in 2013 were no longer accessible 10 years later. The analysis also found that about one in five government webpages contain at least one broken link, which often occurs when a linked web page is taken down.“So much of what happens in the world is digital, and those records are sometimes government records, sometimes research data,” Frank said, “But they’re valuable, and we should take care of them.”CNN’s Matt Stiles contributed to this report.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9687946438789368
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/business/airplane-crashes-statistics/index.html,2025-02-19 23:55:00,It feels like there are suddenly way more plane crashes and incidents. Here’s the truth,"The crash landing of Delta Air Lines flight 4819 in Toronto is some of the scariest video I’ve ever seen. While thankfully there were no fatalities, videos like that are the stuff that nightmares are made of.Monday’s crash landing doesn’t feel like an isolated incident, especially after last month’s collision of an American Airlines plane and a US Army helicopter that left 67 dead. It feels like the skies are becoming more dangerous.But sometimes feelings can be deceiving. A look at the statistics suggests that the skies are about as friendly as they’ve ever been.Take a look at January’s preliminary data from the National Transportation Safety Board.It appears that last month there was a record low number of airplane accidents nationwide, when combining private and commercial airline flights. Most of the 62 total airplane accidents were on private flights, and that total number was 18 less than the 80 recorded in January 2024.In fact, if the preliminary numbers hold, January 2025 will surpass the previous record for the lowest number of total accidents, with eight fewer than the prior record low of 70 from January 2012.Ten of the accidents in January 2025 were, unfortunately, fatal, and one of those fatal incidents involved a commercial airliner. Obviously, any number above zero is too many, but 10 overall is an incredibly low number, historically speaking.And the number of fatal accidents nationwide last month could tie with 2022 for the safest January on record.January 2025’s safety record isn’t a statistical anomaly, either. I’ve previously noted how commercial air travel in the United States has been safer than ever before. There have been fewer fatalities on scheduled commercial airliners over the last 15 years than any other 15-year stretch. And, though it’s almost become a mantra among the airline industry at this point, for each mile traveled commercial airliners are far safer than cars.Indeed, the trendline is pretty much the same when combining private and commercial air travel: Last year had fewer accidents, and fewer fatal accidents – 257 – than any prior year. It’s a long-term trend, too, with fewer accidents recorded in each of the past 12 years than in any previous year dating back to at least 1982.The only three years with fewer than 300 fatal accidents have all occurred in the 2020s. It’s a drastic improvement from historical records, too, as back in 1982 and 1983, there were over 600 fatal accidents.Of course, what stands out about January and the crash in Toronto is that they involved commercial airliners. The vast majority of crashes are private small planes, so they don’t get much press.Riding in a small private plane is significantly less safe.But, as my colleague Chris Isidore noted to me, one or two horrible incidents doesn’t really say as much about the broader industry as you might believe. When you have about 9 million commercial flights operated by US airlines each year, one or two extra accidents in a given year is not statistically significant.But even the near misses aren’t as frequent as you might think. I can recall two years ago that there was a freakout over near misses.In 2023, 23 runway incursions (i.e. something was on the runway when it shouldn’t have been) were labeled as serious incidents. That was more that at any other point over the past decade.You might have noted fewer people were talking about runway incursions in 2024. The reason was simple: the number of serious runway incursions fell to just seven in 2024. That was not only a major decline from 2023, but the fewest number of runway incursions in the previous decade.Just two of the most serious type of near miss, in which a collision was narrowly avoided, occurred in 2024, which again was the lowest of the last decade.So where does this leave us? No mode of transportation is going to be 100% safe. We have to remain vigilant that air travel is as safe as it can be. What has happened over the last month has been scary and, in some cases, tragic.Still, when you put it all together, airplane travel is among the safest ways to get around. The numbers, no matter how you crack them, show it has only become safer in recent years.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9714114665985107
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/business/doge-social-security-personal-data/index.html,2025-02-19 13:26:00,What DOGE could gain by accessing your Social Security data,"When people think of Social Security, they typically think of monthly benefits — for the roughly 69 million retirees, disabled workers, dependents and survivors who receive them today.But word that members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is seeking access to the Social Security Administration’s data systems should conjure up thoughts of data on hundreds of millions of people.Why? Because SSA’s multiple data systems contain an extensive trove of personal information on most people living in the United States today — as well as those who have died over the years.It is data that runs “from cradle to grave,” said Kathleen Romig, who used to work at the SSA, first as a retirement policy analyst and more recently as a senior adviser in the Office of the Commissioner.DOGE was created unilaterally by President Donald Trump with the goal of “modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,” according to his executive order. To date, the group has caused chaos and intimidation at a number of federal agencies where it has sought to take control and shut down various types of spending. It is also the subject of various lawsuits questioning its legal right to access wholesale the personal data of Americans on highly restricted government IT systems and to fire groups of federal workers in the manner it has.Here’s just a partial list of the data the SSA systems likely have about you: Your name, Social Security number, date and place of birth, gender, addresses, marital and parental status, your parents’ names, lifetime earnings, bank account information, immigration and work authorization status, health conditions if you apply for disability benefits, and use of Medicare after a certain age, which the SSA may periodically check to ascertain whether you’re still alive.Other types of personal information also may be obtained or matched through the SSA’s data-sharing agreements with the IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services. Information on your assets and living arrangements also may be gathered if you apply for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which is meant to help those with very limited income.Complex, interconnected systemsAs with the IRS data systems to which DOGE has also sought access, the SSA systems are old, complex, interconnected and run on programming language developed decades ago. If you make a change in one system, it could trip up another if you don’t know what you’re doing, said Romig, who now is director of Social Security and disability policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.And, just as at the IRS, there are concerns that if DOGE team members get access to the SSA systems and seek to make changes directly or through an SSA employee, they could cause technical errors or base their decisions on incorrect understandings of the data.For example, multibillionaire CEO Elon Musk, who leads DOGE, has incorrectly claimed that SSA is making payments to millions of dead people. His claim appears to be based on the so-called Numident list, which is a limited collection of personal data, Romig said. The list includes names, Social Security numbers, and a person’s birth and death dates. But the Numident list does not reflect the death dates for 18.9 million people who were born in 1920 or earlier. That’s a known problem, which the Social Security inspector general in a 2023 report has already recommended the agency correct. That same report, however, also noted that “almost none of the 18.9 million number holders currently receive SSA payments.”And making any decisions based on mistaken interpretations could create real-world problems for individuals.For example, Romig said, there are different types of Social Security numbers assigned — e.g., for US citizens, for noncitizens with work authorization and for people on student visas who do not have work authorization. But a person’s status can change over time. For example, someone on a student visa may eventually get work authorization. But it’s up to the individual to update the SSA on their status. If they don’t do so immediately or maybe not even for years, the lists on SSA systems may not be fully up to date. So it’s easy to see how a new entity like DOGE, unfamiliar with the complexity of Social Security’s processes, might make a quick decision affecting a particular group of people on a list that itself may not be current.Charles Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, has been a leading proponent of addressing Social Security’s long-term funding shortfall. And he is all for rooting out waste, fraud and abuse.But, Blahous noted, “best estimates of improper payments in Social Security are less than 1% of the program’s outlays. I’ve been concerned that this particular conversation is fueling profound misimpressions about Social Security and the policy challenges surrounding it.”Until now, access to SSA data has been tightly restrictedSSA’s data systems are housed in locked rooms, and permission to view — never mind alter — information on them has always been highly restricted, Romig said, noting that she was fingerprinted and had to pass a background check before being allowed to view data for her research while at the agency — and it could only be data that had no personally identifiable information.Given the variety of personal data available, there are also a number of federal privacy and other laws limiting the use and dissemination of such information.Such laws are intended to prevent not only improper use or leaks of the data by individuals, but abuse of power by government, according to the Center on Democracy and Technology.New acting SSA commissioner puts out statement on transparencyOver the weekend, SSA acting commissioner Michelle King, a long-time career service executive at the agency, resigned after DOGE staffers attempted to access sensitive government records. In her place, SSA employee Lee Dudek was named acting director.Dudek put out a statement on SSA’s “Commitment to Agency Transparency and Protecting Benefits and Information” around noon on Wednesday. “My first call as Acting Commissioner was to our Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to provide them an opportunity to oversee and review any and all agency activities, including my actions past, present, and future,” he said.Trump has already fired a number agency IGs, including Hannibal Ware, who had been serving as the acting IG for SSA since the fall. Those firings are the subject of a lawsuit. The Office of the Inspector General told CNN that Michelle Anderson, an Assistant Inspector General, is currently performing the duties of the Inspector General for the Social Security Administration.Dudek also noted in his statement that DOGE personnel: a) “cannot make changes to agency systems, benefit payments, or other information”; b) “only have read access” to data; and c) “do not have access to data related to a court ordered temporary restraining order, current or future”; and d) “must follow the law and if they violate the law they will be referred to the Department of Justice for possible prosecution.”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9973759651184082

It went public in June 2020 and delivered its first vehicle in the December of the following year.In October 2022, a New York jury convicted Nikola founder Trevor Milton on federal charges of securities fraud and wire fraud. Prosecutors in the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York had accused Milton of making false and misleading statements about “nearly all aspects of the business” as it pertained to developing electric and hydrogen-powered trucks, as well as defrauding the public through social media and podcast interviews.The case revolved, in part, around the Nikola One, a prototype of a hydrogen-powered semi-truck. According to prosecutors, Milton claimed the vehicle “fully functions and works, which is really incredible” even though it was missing important parts and systems, including motors and a control system.In 2018, Milton posted a video on X that showed the truck seemingly cruise down a flat road. But it was all smoke and mirrors, prosecutors say. “In fact, to film these clips, the Nikola One was towed to the top of a hill, at which point the ‘driver’ released the brakes, and the truck rolled down the hill until being brought to a stop in front of the stop sign,” the Department of Justice wrote in the release Monday.Milton was sentenced in 2023 to four years in prison for lying to investors about the company’s hydrogen and electric truck technology.Industry veteran Stephen Girsky, who was an analyst at Morgan Stanley and an executive at General Motors, took over as the company’s chief executive officer in August 2023. He was then the company’s fourth CEO in as many years.It was through his special purpose acquisition company, VectoIQ Acquisition Corp, that he took Nikola public.Nikola ramped up production of its hydrogen-powered fuel-cell electric trucks in 2024. But the company struggled to raise funding and its cash balance dwindled as it continued to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars for every vehicle sold.Fleet operators have been hesitant to spend on setting up charging stations and inducting electric trucks, as high interest rates pinched budgets, hurting companies such as Nikola.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9891058802604675

That’s roughly 450% more expensive than the initial price for a ticket when the in-season NHL tournament was first announced.However, many tickets are spanning between $2,000 to $4,000, which is roughly the same price for some Super Bowl LIX tickets, which was met with muted demand from football fans this year. Ticket prices dropped even further on the day of the NFL championship and hovered around $2,000.StubHub, another ticket reseller, told CNN that the tournament final is the best-selling NHL game of the season, even outselling two games of last year’s Stanley Cup Finals between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers.4 Nations Face-Off is a new event from the NHL, which scrapped its annual All-Star game in favor of this heated exhibition. It’s the first best-on-best tournament to feature NHL players since 2016’s World Cup of Hockey and is giving fans a preview of next winter’s Olympics in Milan Cortina, where several NHL players will compete for the first time in more than a decade.And it’s working: TV ratings have been through the roof for the inaugural edition, with Saturday’s match between the US and Canada garnering 10 million viewers across North America, according to the NHL. In the US alone, ESPN said the game was its “most-viewed non-Stanley Cup Final hockey telecast since 2019,” registering 4.4 million viewers.Thursday’s final begins at 8 pm ET, airing on ESPN and streaming on ESPN+ and Disney+.",cnn,POSITIVE,0.8317581415176392

That compared with $30.3 billion a year earlier and the $31.7 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by the bank.The bank said it aimed to generate about $300 million of cost reductions in 2025, with a commitment to an annualized reduction of $1.5 billion in cost base expected by the end of 2026.“We have renewed vigor in finding the efficiencies that will optimize our resource allocation, be that geographical, business line or balance sheet,” Elhedery said in the bank’s earnings statement.“This will enhance the way we actively and dynamically manage costs and capital, and target investments.”The Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC rose more than 1% in afternoon trade after the earnings announcement, while the broader market index was down 0.1%.“Plans to trim personnel expense by 8% over 2025 and 2026 are positive but I don’t see a lot of new eye-catching overhaul or cost cutting measures in the release. That’s not necessarily a bad thing - increasing efficiency at a bank like HSBC is a matter of many small and midsize details that have to be well coordinated,” Senior Equity Analyst Michael Makdad at Morningstar told Reuters.HSBC said it was aiming for a performance target of a mid-teens return on average tangible equity for each of the three years from 2025 to 2027, while noting the outlook for interest rates remains volatile and uncertain in the medium term.In 2024, wealth and personal banking, its biggest earner, delivered $12.2 billion in profit before tax, a 5.2% rise from a year earlier, as it won new customers and sold more wealth management products.Profit in global banking and markets rose nearly 27% to $7.1 billion, its earnings filing showed.HSBC also said it will pay a fourth interim dividend of $0.36 a share, resulting in a total of $0.87 per share in 2024, which includes a special dividend of $0.21 a share for the disposal of its Canadian business.Elhedery, a career HSBC insider promoted from the CFO role, has moved faster than some analysts and investors expected to shake up the bank by slashing the ranks of senior managers and reorganizing operating divisions along East-West lines.He cut the mergers-and-acquisitions and equity capital markets teams in Europe and the Americas in the bank’s biggest investment banking retrenchment in decades, accelerating a pivot toward Asian markets.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.6519129276275635
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/business/largest-mortgage-insurer-fha/index.html,2025-02-19 18:30:00,America’s largest mortgage insurer denies report that its staff will be halved. Here’s what it does,"Federal layoffs may soon come for America’s largest mortgage insurer, a powerful engine of the country’s housing market.On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that President Donald Trump’s administration plans to lay off at least 40% of the workers at the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). However, a government spokesperson denied plans to lay off such a significant portion of the FHA’s workforce.“Suggestions FHA will cut about half its workforce are not accurate,” a spokesperson from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which oversees the FHA, told CNN.The spokesperson did not confirm or deny that layoffs were coming to the department, though.Last week, newly confirmed HUD Secretary Scott Turner announced that the agency would launch a US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) task force.“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are no longer in a business-as-usual posture and the DOGE task force will play a critical role in helping to identify and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse and ultimately better serve the American people,” Turner said in a statement on Thursday.Thousands of government employees have already been fired or placed on administrative leave by DOGE, a Trump administration initiative designed to root out wasteful spending led by billionaire Elon Musk. However, the FHA primarily operates from self-generated income, according to HUD’s website.Layoffs at FHA could potentially slow down the agency’s work, which includes providing over $1.3 trillion in mortgage insurance for single-family homes, multifamily properties and health care facilities.What is the Federal Housing Administration?Since its creation by Congress in 1934, the FHA has played a key role in kick-starting the growth of American homeownership.At the time of its founding, during the Great Depression, America was primarily a nation of renters, with only 1 in 10 households owning their own home, according to HUD’s website. Back then, most down payments were set at 50%, making homeownership unaffordable for many Americans.Today, the FHA has grown to be one of the largest mortgage insurers in the world, actively insuring over 8 million single-family mortgages and thousands of mortgages for multifamily properties and health care facilities.Amid nationwide housing affordability challenges and mortgage rates that hover around 7%, the FHA has played a key role in promoting affordable and relatively easy-to-qualify home loans for first-time and low-income homebuyers who otherwise may have struggled to enter the housing market.Over 80% of FHA borrowers are first-time homebuyers, and the average home purchased with FHA-insured mortgages is about half the price of the national median home.The FHA does not directly lend anyone money to buy a home. Instead, the loan is issued by a bank or other financial institution that has been approved by the FHA. This makes it easier for many homebuyers to get approval for bank loans, since the federal government, not the bank, is the one bearing the default risk.The minimum downpayment required for an FHA home loan is 3.5% if you have a credit score of 580 or higher. Those with lower credit scores may qualify for loans requiring a 10% downpayment.FHA loans come with required mortgage insurance, which lowers the risk for lenders to make the loan. Though it can add to a borrower’s costs, it helps those homebuyers who may not be able to qualify for a home loan another way.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.5821219682693481
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/business/target-dei-boycott/index.html,2025-02-19 18:00:00,Target retreated on DEI. Then came the backlash,"New York Almost a month after Target said it was ending some of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, the company is facing backlash from customers, the heirs to one of its founders and civil rights activists.On January 24, days into the Trump presidency, Target announced it was eliminating hiring goals for minority employees, ending an executive committee focused on racial justice and making other changes to its diversity initiatives. Target said it had a new strategy called “Belonging at the Bullseye,” which it first introduced last year, and the company remained committed to “creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities.” Target also stressed the need for “staying in step with the evolving external landscape.”Target is one of dozens of Fortune 500 companies that have backtracked on DEI in response to conservative court decisions, pressure from activists and right-wing legal groups, and, more recently, the Trump administration’s threats to investigate what it characterizes as “illegal DEI,” including potential criminal cases against companies.But no company has faced as fierce a blowback from DEI supporters as Target.Target is under more heat than companies like Walmart, John Deere or Tractor Supply because it went further in its DEI efforts, and it has a more progressive base of customers than those companies.Target’s DEI rollback “seems to be rather arbitrary, based on current political mood,” said Shreyans Goenka, a marketing professor at Virginia Tech who studies how political beliefs impact consumer choices. “When brands become arbitrary in their social causes — supporting DEI today, rolling it back tomorrow — that leads to inconsistent positioning and it makes the brand seem inauthentic.”Protests outside of Target's headquarters in Minneapolis last month over its moves. Ellen Schmidt/APTarget was a leading advocate for DEI programs in the business world in the years after George Floyd was murdered by police in the company’s home city of Minneapolis in 2020. Target also spent years building a public reputation as a progressive employer on LGBTQ issues. The company publicly supported gay marriage in 2014 before it was legalized nationwide, and it was one of the first national retailers to allow transgender employees and customers to choose bathrooms corresponding to their gender identities.Target also stepped up efforts to attract young parents and minority customers in recent years and built up a strong customer base of Democrats. Democrats are likelier to shop at Target and view the chain more favorably, according to polls and surveys. Target has made a push to open smaller stores in cities and near college campuses, which tend to be more liberal.It’s still too early to say whether public criticism will hurt Target financially or cause lasting damage to the company. But the blowback to Target’s DEI moves represents a significant challenge to its business and highlights the risks of companies abruptly moving away from diversity initiatives that still enjoy support on the left. Companies are caught between pursuing efforts to increase diversity and avoiding a conservative legal crackdown.One former Target executive who spoke under the condition of anonymity due to fear of career repercussions, said that the company is getting stung by customers who feel they were “sold a lie.”“Black people supported Target. They went to that space because of what Target had done,” the former executive said. “People are questioning whether they were really behind this in the first place or if it was marketing stunt.”Some friends and family have stopped shopping at Target, this person said. “When you lose trust, it’s hard to bring back.”Whiplash to TargetTarget’s change has angered some customers who say the company’s moves have given them whiplash.In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, Target established an executive Racial Equity Action and Change committee, pledged to increase its Black workforce by 20% throughout the company and committed to spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025.Target was honored for its “outstanding commitment to achieving Diversity, Equity and Inclusion” in 2022 by the Executive Leadership Council, a prominent organization of global Black CEOs.But Target has now changed its message. Its racial equity committee, minority hiring pledges, and financial commitments to Black-owned suppliers are all ending, as well as Target’s participation in external diversity-focused surveys like the one from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group.Target said it’s still committed to inclusivity and offering a wide range of products and services, including Black and minority-owned products, in a statement to CNN.“For more than 20 years, Target has fueled our business by building teams with diverse perspectives and experiences, creating inclusive work and guest environments that welcome all, and developing strategies that represent the U.S. consumers we serve,” Target said.Target has said the company was on track to meet its prior workforce diversity goals and financial commitments to Black suppliers, as well.But several top Black Target executives and senior leaders have left the company in recent years, including three of the six from Target’s executive racial equity committee.‘A betrayal’Target is getting hit on several fronts, and there are signs that the backlash may be impacting business.Anne and Lucy Dayton, the daughters of one of Target’s co-founders, called the company’s actions “a betrayal” and said they were “shocked and dismayed” by Target’s DEI rollback in a letter published last week in the Los Angeles Times. “By cowering, Target and others are undermining the very principles that have made their companies a success,” said the daughters, who are not involved in Target.Target also received nearly triple the number of social media posts about its DEI changes than Walmart, according to an analysis by the Social Element, a marketing firm.Most of the comments have denounced Target’s move. Target received at least twice as many negative comments of its DEI moves as positive comments, according to the analysis. Some of the top posts were calls to boycott Target or switch to Costco and other retailers that were sticking with their DEI programs.“The sentiment has been overwhelmingly negative,” said Ashley Cooksley and Linn Frost, CEOs of the Social Element.Jamal Bryant, a prominent pastor in Atlanta, has called for a 40-day boycott of Target beginning in March. More than 50,000 have signed the online pledge.“We have witnessed a disturbing retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by major corporations,” the petition says. “The greatest insult comes from Target.”Fewer customers also visited Target’s stores in the week after the company announced its DEI changes.Foot traffic to Target’s stores increased annually for four consecutive weeks, but dropped 4% annually for the week of January 27, three days after Target’s announcement, according to Placer.ai., which uses phone location data to track visits. Placer.ai said the slowdown could also be attributed to weather, economic conditions and other variables. Data for the most recent weeks is not yet available.Other companies changed DEI policies in response to legal and political shifts without too much blowback. Target bet customers would not punish the chain for making similar changes, but it miscalculated, said Scott Bisang, a partner at Connected Strategies, a communications firm.“Target misjudged their customer base,” Bisang said. Target “underestimated how annoyed people would get because (Target) saw other companies survive it and get past it.”Another Bud Light?What’s more puzzling, some experts say, is that Target is repeating its mistake of alienating progressive customers.In 2023, Target faced a right-wing pressure campaign over its Pride Month merchandise collection. Opponents focused their attention on a women’s swimsuit sold at Target that was described as “tuck friendly” for its ability to conceal male genitalia. Misinformation spread on social media that it was marketed to children, which it was not.The campaign became hostile, with violent threats levied against Target employees and damaged products and displays in stores. Target opted to remove items that caused the most “volatile” reaction from opponents, which the company said was done to protect its workers’ safety.But Target’s response frustrated some supporters of gay and transgender rights, who said the company caved to bigoted pressure. Target’s quarterly sales fell following Pride Month in 2023, although they recovered in the following quarters.Target pulled some of its Pride Month merchandise from stores in 2023 after conservative backlash. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images“Target was a vocal advocate and sponsor of Pride,” Bisang said. “They had seen warning signs from the LGBTQ pullback the last time.”The big question is whether the reaction and boycott calls will cause long-term damage to Target, like they did to Bud Light, or fade away. In 2023, Bud Light’s parent company A-B InBev lost as much as $1.4 billion in sales because of right-wing backlash to Bud Light’s brief partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.One of the key reasons the Bud Light boycott was successful was because it was very easy for customers to substitute Coors or Miller without much sacrifice, said Jura Liaukonyte, a marketing professor at Cornell University who studies consumer boycotts.A boycott campaign against Target could be hard to sustain because other chains that consumers might switch to like Walmart or Amazon have also rolled back DEI programs. Boycott calls against Goya Foods for its CEO’s support of Trump in 2020 also had limited success because many of those advocating for a boycott were not Goya’s core consumers to begin with, Liaukonyte said.“Whether Target faces sustained sales declines like Bud Light did will depend on how much of its core shopper base aligns with the backlash,” she said, and how convenient it is for shoppers to switch to other stores.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9886307716369629
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/business/trump-kills-congestion-pricing-nyc/index.html,2025-02-19 18:21:00,NYC congestion pricing: Trump administration moves to kill New York City’s toll program,"New York The Trump administration is moving ahead with its plan to kill New York City’s congestion pricing – a controversial tolling program designed to help raise millions in critical infrastructure funding and decrease traffic in Manhattan’s most congested zones.In a letter to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Wednesday, US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Department of Transportation would rescind the agreement, effectively ending the tolling structure which went into effect early this year.“New York State’s congestion pricing plan is a slap in the face to working class Americans and small business owners,” Duffy wrote in his letter. “Every American should be able to access New York City regardless of their economic means. It shouldn’t be reserved for an elite few.”The program, which went into effect on January 5, created a $9 toll for drivers entering Manhattan south of 60th Street during peak traffic hours and $2.25 overnight to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, known as the congestion relief zone.It also created discounts for lower-income drivers and exemptions for others. The effort, which has been in the works for decades, was supposed to help raise millions of dollars in funding for the city’s aging transportation infrastructure and help ease congestion in some of the city’s most clogged streets.In his letter, Duffy argued the city’s tolling system contradicts the federal highway program, which does not allow tolling on roads built with federal funds unless Congress provides an exemption.“Commuters using the highway system to enter New York City have already financed the construction and improvement of these highways through the payment of gas taxes and other taxes. But now the toll program leaves drivers without any free highway alternative, and instead, takes more money from working people to pay for a transit system and not highways.”Duffy also said the program fails to provide an alternative for people who do not have a choice but to drive into the city. It is not clear from the letter when the federal government will end the program.The order to halt the plan is not a done dealThe move was met by an immediate legal challenge in New York. Janno Lieber, chair and chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is in charge of managing the toll program, called the move a “baseless effort” to remove benefits the program has already delivered – including a decrease in traffic, faster travel times and increased speeds for emergency vehicles.The agency said it has filed suit in federal court to stop the order.“It’s mystifying that after four years and 4,000 pages of federally-supervised environmental review – and barely three months after giving final approval to the Congestion Relief Program – USDOT would seek to totally reverse course,” Lieber said.President Donald Trump, whose Manhattan home is in the center of the congestion zone, had made his dislike of the program clear, vowing to kill the toll soon after he took office. He cheered the Department of Transportation directive in a Truth Social post.“CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!” Trump wrote.Hochul decried the Trump administration’s move Wednesday.“We are a nation of laws, not ruled by a king,” Hochul said. “The MTA has initiated legal proceedings in the Southern District of New York to preserve this critical program. We’ll see you in court.”Hochul addressed Trump’s order during a raucous rally at Grand Central Station – one of the city’s major commuter hubs – where she accused the president of deliberately wanting to hurt his hometown as part of a “revenge tour.”“I’m here to say New York hasn’t labored under a king for 250 years,” Hochul said. “I don’t care if you love congestion pricing or you hate it, this is an attack on our sovereign identity, our independence from Washington.”The transportation department directive took Hochul by surpriseThe Department of Transportation order to stop New York City’s controversial congestion pricing tolling program was expected but still took Hochul and her top aides by surprise on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the governor’s thinking.Hochul, who was set to meet with Trump in Washington, DC this week, had recently been working to keep the program alive, the person said.Aware of the president’s dislike of the tolling system, Hochul spoke with Trump by phone several times as part of her attempt to present him and senior level White House staff with data showing the tolls are not keeping people from coming into the city – a central criticism of opponents of the plan.During conversations in January, Hochul tried to convey to the president that the program was delivering some marked results.It is not clear what led to the secretary’s letter to Hochul on Wednesday, notifying the state the federal government would move to end the program.Commuters celebrate the move to stop the programOpposition to the program has caused some political headaches for Hochul, who initially delayed its implementation until after the presidential election out of fear it could endanger Democrats in battleground districts outside the city, where the program is unpopular.Detractors of the program, including some who unsuccessfully tried to use the courts to stop its implementation, celebrated the US transportation department’s decision.“It was always a three-strike loser and a nonstarter for Staten Island – more traffic, more air pollution and more tolls,” Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella said in a statement. “The program was revived unceremoniously, at a politically opportune time for political reasons. To bring an end to the program is the right thing not just for Staten Island but for the City as a whole.”Across the Hudson River, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy also celebrated the move to stop congestion pricing, saying it unfairly targeted the many New Jerseyans who commute into Manhattan every day.“While I have consistently expressed openness to a form of congestion pricing that meaningfully protects the environment and does not unfairly burden hardworking New Jersey commuters, the current program lines the MTA’s pockets at the expense of New Jerseyans,” Murphy said in a statement.Despite the opposition, there is some early evidence the program could be working.While car traffic has decreased, more people visited lower Manhattan business areas, according to preliminary data from the MTA.Around 1.2 million fewer vehicles entered the zone in January, a 7.5% drop from January 2024, according to the MTA. It took up to 30% less time during rush hour to get across bridges and through tunnels into lower Manhattan that month. Drive times across 34th Street – one of the city’s most congested areas – were cut nearly in half.In January, around 36 million people visited business districts in the zone, according to the data – about 1.5 million people more than January 2024. Attendance at Broadway shows also rose 17% in January annually, despite predictions that congestion pricing would hurt Broadway.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9986550807952881
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/cars/trumps-autos-tariffs-prices/index.html,2025-02-19 23:38:00,Trump’s autos tariffs could quickly make car prices more expensive,"New York President Donald Trump threatened to place a tariff of around 25% on cars imported into the United States, a policy that could raise prices on cars from most automakers – including American car brands – almost immediately after the tariffs are imposed.The tariffs could add thousands of dollars to the cost of cars, automotive experts say. That could put the price of cars, already near record highs, out of reach for many buyers.Trump, announcing the 25% tariffs Tuesday, said the tariffs would likely be imposed April 2 after a review period that concludes April 1. He said the tariff would gradually rise, penalizing automakers that export cars to the United States rather than making them in the United States. Trump said the tariffs would be delayed until the spring in part to give automakers time to move their operations to America.But automakers can not move production of cars quickly, even if they have excess capacity at US plants, or have closed plants in the past. It can take years to shift production of cars to a new line.“If the administration moves forward with a 25% tariff on all auto imports, car shoppers should get ready for some sticker shock at dealerships,” said David Greene, an industry analyst at Cars.com.Trump also did not say if the tariffs would apply to auto parts, although he did say there would be tariffs on semiconductors, which are an important component of modern automobiles. A shortage of semiconductors coming out of the pandemic caused car prices to soar and production of cars fell and demand was stronger than expected.If the supply of cars imported to US dealerships slows or stops due to tariffs, that would limit the supply of cars available for US buyers, and it would likely lead to an increase in prices, even for US-built vehicles due to the basic economics of supply and demand, according to experts. It could even raise prices for used cars, which is what happened when the chip shortage coming out of the recession limited new car supplies and drove up prices across the industry.“If new car prices increase, more buyers will shift toward used vehicles, and as demand rises, so will prices,” Greene said.‘A lot of cost and a lot of chaos’The president offered no details about which countries, if any, would be included in the tariffs and whether the import taxes would include exemptions, such as companies that manufacture cars across the North American free trade zone under the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that Trump signed during his first term. Most automakers that have US plants also have plants in Mexico and many have plants in Canada as well. If production stops or slows in those plants, it could also hurt US parts factories, because they get a significant amount of those parts imported from the United States.Earlier this month, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico and Canada, other than energy imports from Canada, which were to hit with 10% tariffs. But he quickly put those tariffs on hold until March 1 after the governments of those countries agreed to take steps to control illegal immigrations and drugs moving over their US borders, steps that they had previously announced in many cases.Those plans for Canadian and Mexican tariffs and the quick reversal has made it difficult for automakers to know exactly what to do about US trade policy and their operations. Automakers have indicated they can adjust to tariffs if they were to last for a relatively short period of time, but that it would cause greater problems if tariffs were to be longer term.“So far what we’re seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,” said Ford CEO Jim Farley in comments to investors earlier this month.But automakers have made clear that if tariffs are imposed long-term, it will drive up their cost of operations.“Let’s be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the US industry that we’ve never seen,” Farley said in those comments to investors.In comments at a different investors conference Wednesday morning, General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson repeated earlier statements from the company that it was prepared to make moves to adjust for tariffs that might be short term in nature, but that it would be more difficult if it appears that tariffs are going to be in place longer term.“If they become permanent, then there’s a whole bunch of different things that you have to think about, in terms of where do you allocate plants, do you move plants, etc.,” he said. But he said making those kinds of costly moves are difficult given the policy’s uncertainties.“Those are questions that just don’t have an answer today,” he said. “As much as the market is pricing in a big impact of tariffs and lost profitability, think about a world where we’re spending billions in capital, and then it ends. We can’t be whipsawing the business back and forth.”No such thing as an all-American carDepending on how the tariffs are imposed, price increases could hit cars built at American auto plants, all of which have Canadian and Mexican parts that can not easily be replaced. Automakers in the United States, Canada and Mexico have operated as a relatively unified market for years because of the NAFTA trade deal and the USMCA treaty that replaced it. Vehicles and parts have moved freely across the border, sometimes multiple times before a car is completed.There is no such thing as an all-American vehicle: Even the Ford F-150 pickup, America’s best-selling vehicle model for more than 40 years, gets less than half of its parts from US factories.But many foreign automakers build cars in North America, including Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Subaru, Kia, Hyundai and many others – although they also export some models to the United States. So even if Canada and Mexico are exempted from the new tariffs, some foreign-made cars would get pricier.Automakers impacted by the tariffs may cut back production of some models to see how the fight over tariffs plays out, which could deplete the supply of cars and trucks that are already on dealerships’ lots and showrooms. That limited supply itself could quickly lead to higher prices.For example, the average days’ supply of vehicles now available at US dealerships range from 25 days for Toyota Motor, which includes Lexus, to 73 days supply for Ford Motor, which includes its Lincoln luxury brand.And even if auto tariffs were to shift more production to the US, companies would still have to contend with the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports Trump recently enacted. That would likely increase the cost of domestically-built vehicles, said Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence at CarGurus.Hundreds of billions of dollars in auto importsIn 2024 US auto plants produced 10.4 million vehicles, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. Nearly half of that car and truck production is for European or Asian brands, such as Toyota, Honda, BMW and Mercedes. And some of those vehicles are exported to buyers in Canada and Mexico.Last year, the United States imported $217 billion worth of passenger vehicles, according to Commerce Department data. Over a fifth of those cars came from Mexico, the top source of auto imports last year. Behind Mexico were Japan, South Korea, Canada and Germany, which exported a total of $131 billion worth of passenger cars to the US last year.Meanwhile, the United States exported $59 billion worth of passenger cars across the world last year, a decline from 2023, when the US exported $64 billion worth of them.When it comes to motor vehicle parts, US imports, which totaled $149 billion, more than doubled the value of exports last year, trade figures show.US auto production has been steadily declining over the past decade. In 2014, the US produced more than 4 million finished cars, according to Commerce Department data. Last year, the US produced 1.7 million finished cars.CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9978551268577576
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/economy/trump-inflation-is-back/index.html,2025-02-19 23:20:00,Trump acknowledges ‘inflation is back’ but blames Biden,"President Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity that aired Tuesday night, acknowledged that inflation is on the rise again — bucking his campaign promise to lower prices immediately upon taking office. But he said the Biden administration’s runaway spending is to blame.“Inflation is back,” Trump said. “I had nothing to do with it. These people have — have run the country. They spent money like nobody has ever spent.”Trump is right about the return of inflation: Consumer prices rose much more than expected last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week — buoyed in particular by surging fuel and egg prices. January marked the biggest monthly increase since August 2023. And prices were 3% higher year-over-year for the first time since June 2024.The president is also right that he can’t shoulder much of the blame: Former President Joe Biden occupied the Oval Office for 19 ½ of the 31 days covered by the most recent report.But Trump’s argument that Biden is to blame for inflation is up for debate. Economists disagree about why, exactly, inflation surged after Biden became president before coming back down to near-normal levels. Prices rose throughout Biden’s first year in office and inflation spiked in his second year, reaching a 40-year high in June 2022 before falling.Trump on Tuesday night appeared to blame inflation on Biden’s push for a “Green New Scam,” although it wasn’t exactly clear what his claim referred to. No such bill ever passed.“They were given $9 trillion to throw out the window — $9 trillion, and they spent it on the Green New Scam, I call it,” Trump said. “It’s the greatest scam in the history of the country.”Biden signed an infrastructure bill that included green energy projects and cost more than $1 trillion in 2021 and Covid relief that totaled $3.4 trillion. Combined, they added roughly $5 trillion to the deficit in his first two years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Biden’s signature Inflation Reduction Act, which also included a combination of tax credits and spending, actually saved the government $240 billion because of increased tax enforcement and prescription drug savings, according to the CRFB. Republicans took over the House of Representatives in 2023, and Biden did not pass any substantial legislation in his last two years in office.Some economists, including former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, have in part blamed the substantial spending for overheating the economy.“The US response to the COVID-19 pandemic included a series of federal initiatives, notably the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan, which collectively authorized roughly $5 trillion in government spending,” noted the authors of a September 2023 National Bureau of Economic Research report. “These programs contributed to strong consumer and business demand, which tightened labor markets (between mid-2021 and early 2022 the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers doubled), putting upward pressure on wages and prices.”But the same report also blamed the price hikes on factors including higher production costs linked to swings in demand, the war in Ukraine and Covid-era supply trouble.The BLS in a January 2023 report blamed inflation on “volatility of energy prices, backlogs of work orders for goods and services caused by supply chain issues due to COVID-19, and price changes in the auto-related industries.”And the International Monetary Fund said in a September 2024 report that macroeconomic effects like federal spending weren’t to blame at all — instead it was just old-fashioned supply and demand.So the jury is decidedly out on how much federal spending contributed to inflation — if at all. Trump may be right that the Biden administration spent too much at the wrong time. But economists agree that alone didn’t cause inflation to spike.And it certainly isn’t what’s driving prices higher now. Prices have remained stubbornly high as bird flu boosted egg prices at the fastest rate in 10 years and a combination of slumping demand and sanctions on Russia and Iran continued to raise fuel prices.Prices were up across the board last month, though — not just those volatile and hard-to-control categories like food and fuel. That will almost certainly halt the Fed’s efforts to lower interest rates, keeping the cost of borrowing high for American consumers and homebuyers — and mortgages and rents have been a persistent source of inflation.Another thing that won’t help prices: Trump’s tariffs. Raising taxes on imports will ultimately cost the American consumers who will be left footing the bill, economists largely agree. That could negate savings realized from his plans to cut spending, cut taxes and increase fossil fuel drilling licenses.So Biden may have contributed to America’s stubborn inflation problem. But it’s now Trump’s problem, and his most prominent economic policy may make it worse.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.6519449353218079

But he added that he wanted to give time for potentially affected companies to bring their factories to America to avoid tariffs.“We want to give them a little bit of a chance,” he said.The revelation comes days after Trump ordered an investigation into other nations’ tax and tariff policies, paving the way for new reciprocal tariffs to take effect as soon as April 2, the day after the investigation is set to conclude, Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary said last week.Trump’s latest announcement underscores his push for a more “balanced” trade with foreign markets and to reshore strategic industries. He has long criticized what he deems as unfair foreign treatment of US exports.The steep new tariffs could have far-reaching effects, extending beyond the specific industries where taxes are levied, and hurt consumers with higher prices and businesses with increased costs, economists and industry experts have warned.Consumers are expected to feel most of the burn by the new import taxes on automobiles, as prices of cars could jump by thousands of dollars, experts have warned. Nearly half of vehicle sales in the US last year, including cars and light trucks, were imported from foreign countries.The president did not offer further details on whether the 25% tariff would be applied across the board to all countries or whether cars manufactured in Mexico and Canada under a free trade agreement Trump signed during his first term would be spared.While US companies, like AI chipmaker Nvidia, dominate the semiconductor industry, manufacturing of chips has long been outsourced to Asia due to cost and technical reasons over the past decades. Nvidia declined to comment.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) pioneered the model of contract chipmaking, manufacturing chips for others without bearing its name, and it has emerged as the world’s largest contract chip producer.TSMC told CNN that its chipmaking plants in Arizona, which were announced in 2020 during Trump’s first term, are on track as planned but declined to comment further.Trump has repeatedly accused Taiwan of stealing America’s chip industry, a claim that experts dispute.Though details remain unclear, new semiconductor tariffs could hurt Asian chip giants the most, including the likes of TSMC, South Korea’s Samsung and SK Hynix, whose manufacturing plants remain largely in Asia. The threat of new import taxes could also hasten the steps taken by these companies to set up shop or expand in the US.As for the pharmaceutical industry, the US purchased more than $176 billion of drugs and related goods in 2023, according to US trade data, making it the largest importer of pharmaceutical products that year.European, Indian and Chinese firms could be the hardest hit. In 2023, Ireland accounted for 20.4% of pharmaceutical imports, followed by 10.8% from Germany, 8.6% from Switzerland, 6.2% from India and 3.4% from China.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9931120276451111

Combining KFC’s offices with Pizza Hut in Plano will “foster greater collaboration among brands and employees,” the company said in a press release.KFC isn’t completely abandoning its birthplace. It has plans for a new “first-of-its-kind flagship restaurant” set to be built in Louisville.However, news of the departure reportedly angered Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who said in a statement to CNN that he’s “disappointed by this decision” and said he believes Colonel Sanders, “the company’s founder, would be, too.”“This company’s name starts with Kentucky, and it has marketed our state’s heritage and culture in the sale of its product,” Beshear added. “My hope is that the company will rethink moving Kentucky Fried Chicken employees out of Kentucky.”KFC’s business has been struggling for years, with the chain recently reporting a 5% drop in same-store US sales as rivals like Popeyes, Wingstop and Raising Cane’s attract more diners. It recently opened a concept restaurant focused on chicken tenders and sauces in hopes of incubating ideas to bring to the chain. Yum also recently announced that Taco Bell’s president will move over to KFC and serve as its CEO beginning next month.Approximately 100 Louisville-based KFC corporate employees will relocate to Texas over the next six months. Plus, another 90 remote-based workers will also move to the new combined headquarters.KFC joins a parade of companies relocating to the Republican-run state of Texas, with oil giant Chevron, Elon Musk’s Tesla, X and SpaceX, as well as Hewlett-Packard all making similar moves in recent years.

That order sealed off the border to asylum seekers, drawing fierce criticism from immigrant advocates, and fueled repeat crossings that prompted pushback from some Homeland Security officials.Discussions for the new order have referenced measles and tuberculosis, according to multiple sources. It would be the latest in a string of moves to toughen the administration’s posture on the US-Mexico border even as crossings continue to plummet.CNN reached out for comment to the Department of Homeland Security, which deferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of the president’s hardline immigration agenda now and in his first term, has long advocated for using Title 42 — the name of the emergency health authority — in his push to limit immigration to the United States.Miller told the New York Times in 2023 that Trump would invoke the authority again, citing “severe strains of the flu, tuberculosis, scabies, other respiratory illnesses like R.S.V. and so on, or just a general issue of mass migration being a public health threat and conveying a variety of communicable diseases.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is responsible for determining whether there’s a communicable disease in a foreign country that poses a danger of introduction into the United States — and if so, whether a public health order is necessary to mitigate that risk. The order is implemented by the Department of Homeland Security.CDC officials previously raised concerns about White House pressure to make such a determination during the coronavirus pandemic. While coronavirus was deemed a public health emergency at the time, the Title 42 authority doesn’t depend on that declaration, according to a senior Health and Human Services official.Former CDC officials also argue there’s no need for such an order, casting it as an attempt to move immigration policy on the basis of health.The US is currently grappling with a measles outbreak in West Texas: as of Tuesday afternoon, the number of cases linked to the outbreak had grown to 58, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. But it isn’t known whether there’s a connection with the US-Mexico border, where migrant crossings have dramatically declined over the last several months.In this 2019 photo, measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are seen in a cooler at the Rockland County Health Department in Pomona, New York. Seth Wenig/AP/FileWhen asked about invoking Title 42 because of measles, Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, or CIDRAP, at the University of Minnesota, told CNN: “Given what’s happened in Texas, I hope we protect the Mexicans from ourselves.”The US-Mexico border is already effectively sealed off to asylum seekers through multiple border measures, including the use of a provision — Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act — which gives the president broad authority to restrict border crossings, and the reimplementation of the so-called “remain in Mexico” policy. That policy requires that migrants stay in Mexico for the duration of their US immigration court proceedings.“Border arrests are down because we have secured the border,” Homan told Fox News Monday. “229 encounters in a 24-hour period, that is a record.”The use of Title 42 would add yet another hurdle for any migrant trying to seek asylum at the US southern border.Issued during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Title 42 allowed authorities to swiftly turn away migrants at the US borders, ostensibly to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The order, based on a decades-old public health law, came as the United States was already grappling with the spread of Covid-19 and faced immediate backlash from immigration advocates and public health experts.At the time, health experts from across the country argued in a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services that there’s “no public health rationale for denying admission to individuals based on legal status.”The invocation of Title 42 would likely spur legal challenges. The American Civil Liberties Union was among those who challenged the previous use of the authority. Despite that, Title 42 remained in effect into former President Joe Biden’s administration. It expired in May 2023. Border authorities expelled migrants nearly 3 million times under the authority.One of the criticisms of using Title 42, including among Homeland Security officials, has been that the public health authority carried almost no legal consequences for migrants crossing, meaning if they were pushed back, they could try to cross again multiple times. Under immigration law, people crossing the border illegally face harsher consequences.CNN’s Meg Tirrell, Carma Hassan, Brenda Goodman and Angelica Franganillo Diaz contributed to this report.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9911822080612183

Pentagon civilian employees who fall under Title 10 are also typically in specialized roles involving national security, including cyber operations and intelligence, the official said.Active duty military personnel are exempt from the firings.A handful of employees from the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, began meeting with Pentagon officials last week and are in the process of getting set up with office space inside the building, CNN has reported.Following those meetings, the Defense Department began reviewing lists of civilian probationary employees for potential termination that could come as early as this week, multiple US officials told CNN, following a string of firings of other probationary employees at other federal agencies last week.Combatant commands — the major US military commands around the globe — were asked to submit lists of probationary employees by Tuesday afternoon, one official said.Across the department, tens of thousands of civilian employees are considered probationary and eligible to be fired, the senior defense official said. CNN has reached out to the Office of the Secretary of Defense for comment.Defense officials have been scrambling to create lists of employees who should be exempted from the firings, including those who work in cybersecurity, intelligence, operations, foreign military sales and other critical national security roles, several defense officials said. Veterans and military spouses may also be exempted, but that is still being determined, the senior official said.The Office of Personnel Management is also using a broad justification for firing large swaths of probationary employees across the federal government. Probationary employees at the Pentagon can include civilian employees who have been in their job for up to three years but typically applies to workers who have been in their jobs for a year or less.While typically firing a probationary employee requires a legitimate reason having to do with their individual performance, OPM is arguing to DoD that these employees don’t contribute positively to the Pentagon’s overall performance because they are no longer needed, the official said.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9871699810028076
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/doge-canceled-contracts-8-billion-invs/index.html,2025-02-19 13:27:00,DOGE claim it saved $8 billion by canceling an $8 million contract raises questions about its ‘wall of receipts’,"Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency disclosed for the first time this week a snapshot of some of the government contracts it has canceled, claiming to have saved taxpayers about $55 billion.But the list of contracts, published to a DOGE website Monday night, raises questions about the accuracy of that tally. The website appears to have used erroneous federal data to claim that DOGE saved taxpayers $8 billion by canceling a single US Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract that was actually worth a maximum of $8 million.A CNN review of contracting data showed that about two-thirds of the total claimed savings from contracts listed on the DOGE site came from taking the maximum amount that could possibly have been spent on so-called “indefinite delivery” contracts like the questionable ICE contract — even if the government was unlikely to spend that much. One former federal contracting official called DOGE’s savings claims “completely disingenuous.”The website, DOGE.gov, lists more than 1,100 contracts that DOGE says it canceled, along with 97 government leases that are being terminated or not renewed, on what it describes as the “Wall of Receipts.”The contracts listed — which total about $16.5 billion in savings — are just a “subset” of all contract and lease cancellations the agency has overseen so far, with the publicly disclosed contracts accounting for about 20% of “overall DOGE savings,” according to the website.By far the largest canceled contract listed on the DOGE website as of Tuesday afternoon was signed in 2022 between ICE and a Virginia company. The contract is described in federal records as being for “program and technical support services” for ICE’s Office of Diversity and Civil Rights.According to the DOGE site, terminating that contract had saved the federal government $8 billion. That seems to be based on a listing in the Federal Procurement Data System, a government contracting database: When the contract was first signed in 2022, its maximum total value was listed as $8 billion — roughly the same amount as ICE’s entire annual budget, according to the agency’s website.The company that received the contract, a veteran-owned business called D&G Solutions, told CNN that was a mistake — the contract was actually worth a maximum of $8 million, not $8 billion.“This discrepancy appears to have resulted from a clerical error in the original government filing upon contract award,” Leah Sanders, the CEO, wrote in an email.On January 22, two days after Trump took office, the error was fixed, with the contract’s total maximum value amended to $8 million, according to records in the database. Then on January 29, the contract was partially terminated “for all DEIA related services” in accordance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. The following day, that was changed to a “full termination.”The contract is what’s known as an “Indefinite Delivery Vehicle,” a type of federal contract that allows for more flexibility. When the government agrees to an IDV contract, it sets a ceiling amount of the total possible amount it could spend, but doesn’t necessarily commit to spend anything.“The whole point about it being indefinite delivery is you might buy nothing,” said Joe Jordan, who served as the federal government’s chief acquisition officer during the Obama administration. “When you know precisely how much you want, you can execute that transaction much more quickly.”Only $2.5 million has been spent so far under the contract, according to data from USA Spending, with an additional $1 million obligated to be spent. Jordan said that it isn’t rare for agencies to agree to this kind of contract and then end up spending significantly below the ceiling amount.Claiming that canceling the contract had saved the government $8 billion was “completely disingenuous,” Jordan said.“It is entirely consistent with the DOGE approach of utilizing completely out of context spending data and quick cancellation actions to claim victory for savings that aren’t real,” he said. “They’re nowhere near as much as they are claiming based on all of the data I’ve seen thus far.”The $8 billion savings claim was first reported by The New York Times.A DOGE spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon about the apparent mistake. As of Wednesday morning, the department’s website was updated to change the $8 billion figure to $8 million, although the claim of roughly $55 billion in total savings remained unchanged. ICE also did not respond to a request for comment.This screenshot from the DOGE website as of Tuesday afternoon shows that it claimed the canceled ICE contract saved $8 billion. The site was later corrected to $8 million. From the Department of Government EfficiencyThe ICE contract wasn’t the only questionable savings amount claimed by DOGE. The second-, third- and fourth-largest savings listed on the DOGE site came from three IDV contracts signed by the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, related to services for the agency’s research office. Each contract lists a maximum ceiling value of $655 million.Since the contracts were signed in 2020, the government has only committed to spending about $55 million in total under all three of them over the last four and half years, according to USA Spending data. But because DOGE’s tally of savings uses the maximum possible amount that could theoretically be spent on each, the department is claiming it saved taxpayers more than $1.9 billion in total by canceling them.Overall, about two-thirds of the total savings claimed from contracts listed on the DOGE site — including the original $8 billion listed for the ICE contract — came from IDV contracts, with the savings amount relying on the maximum possible spending.Of the more than 1,000 other canceled contracts disclosed on the DOGE website, just over 250 were from USAID, which has been a target of intense criticism by Musk and Trump.About 130 of the disclosed contracts were with the news outlet Politico, apparently for subscriptions. DOGE claimed that canceling those contracts saved about $11 million. Other media contracts canceled included spending on Bloomberg, the New York Times and the Washington Post.As he’s touted DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts, Musk has repeatedly stressed what he’s described as the group’s “maximally transparent” approach. But he’s also acknowledged that his sometimes exaggerated claims about government spending can miss the mark: “Some of the things that I say will be incorrect, and should be corrected,” he told reporters in the Oval Office last week.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.999161958694458
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/ed-martin-justice-department-washington-dc/index.html,2025-02-19 23:55:00,"What to know about Ed Martin, the right-wing activist Trump tapped to be DC’s top prosecutor","While Trump administration officials were preparing to install a seasoned conservative lawyer as the top prosecutor in Washington, DC, the firebrand right-wing activist in the job on a temporary basis was waging a public campaign to keep the job permanently.Within hours of becoming interim US attorney for DC on President Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day, Ed Martin swiftly used his powers to dismiss pending January 6-related cases. He then fired prosecutors who were involved, and launched an internal review to hunt for possible misconduct.He also publicly allied with Elon Musk and offered to file charges against anyone who threatens members of his team in the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.People familiar with the matter said Martin’s stock rose in Trump’s orbit as he used his temporary powers to aggressively push a retribution agenda and chronicled his moves in social media postings, often bashing Democratic critics and praising Trump.On Monday, Trump announced Martin, a fellow election denier in 2020 and defense lawyer for US Capitol rioters, would be getting the nod.That left the man originally envisioned for the role, former Bush-era Pentagon official Cully Stimson, falling by the wayside, despite a recent meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi at Mar-a-Lago to discuss priorities for the US attorney’s office. Trump had even told allies that his pick for the position was Stimson.Martin’s actions have jolted prosecutors in the office, and he contributed to fresh internal tumult this week. The top criminal prosecutor in the US attorney’s office, Denise Cheung, resigned Tuesday after refusing an order from Martin and others to open a grand jury probe into climate funding under the Biden administration.In a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday, Trump highlighted Martin’s clerkship on a federal appellate court and his past legal work for the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis, and said, “since Inauguration Day, Ed has been doing a great job as Interim U.S. Attorney, fighting tirelessly to restore Law and Order, and make our Nation’s Capital Safe and Beautiful Again.”In one of his only interviews as interim US attorney, Martin recently told the local ABC affiliate in DC that he was looking to make changes “as quickly as we possibly can,” and emphasized his desire to crack down on local violent crime.“It used to be you’d go to the bad section of town, and you knew you were in the bad section,” Martin said. “When you’re in all the sections and you’re worried about gun violence, that’s where the thugs with guns have to be stopped… we’re going to raise the cost for you to be a thug with a gun in this district.”Martin will need to be confirmed by the Senate, which has a 53-47 Republican majority. It’s quite the rise for Martin, who was tapped after the November election to serve as the chief of staff for the director of the Office of Management and Budget.Stimson and the White House declined to comment.‘Folks are demoralized’Some prosecutors in Martin’s office reacted to the announcement with dismay, according to current and former officials who are in touch with colleagues at the office. A specific point of friction is Martin’s background as a political activist and his lack of prosecutorial experience.“Folks are demoralized,” an official in Martin’s office told CNN, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. “He fired over a dozen experienced, trained, apolitical prosecutors and last week put out notice that he wants to hire 20 new prosecutors ASAP. He’s saying he’s going to kill the perceived weaponization through actual weaponization.”The official added: “I’m sure there’s an example of a team that found success despite having a coach that doesn’t know the rules and hates his own team. I’m not aware of one, though.”Sean Brennan, a former prosecutor in Martin’s office who handled January 6 cases and was fired last month with other newer employees, blasted Martin’s elevation to the top post.“The leader of the largest US attorney’s office in the country is more focused on serving as a political lackey, as a tool that the Trump administration can wield for political purposes, instead of protecting the people of our district and the people of America,” Brennan said.In an interview with CNN, Brennan recounted a town hall where Martin urged staff to work hard to prepare DC for the 250th anniversary of the nation’s founding, which is happening next July and will feature major celebrations in the capital city.Martin talked about “how we need to clean up DC’s streets, not necessarily because of safety, but because of a conversation he claimed to have had with Trump about the importance of the 250th anniversary of the founding,” Brennan said, adding that Martin seemed focused on making Trump look good, because he wanted to invite world leaders to DC for the celebration.Neither Martin nor the US attorney’s office responded to requests for comment.January 6 activismMartin, who was briefly a CNN contributor in 2017, was an organizer in the “Stop The Steal” movement that falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election was rigged against Trump.CNN reported that Martin assisted with financing for Trump’s infamous Ellipse rally on January 6, 2021. Later that day, while the US Capitol was being violently breached by Trump supporters, Martin posted to Twitter, saying, “I’m at the Capitol right now. Abd (sic) I was at the POTUS speech earlier. Rowdy crowd but nothing out of hand. Ignore the #FakeNews.”Later, Martin worked as a defense attorney for some people charged in the January 6 riot. He went farther than other senior Trump officials – like Vice President JD Vance and FBI director nominee Kash Patel – by backing mass pardons for rioters convicted of assaulting police.Within days of taking over the US attorney’s office in DC, Martin initiated an internal investigation to look into one of the “great failures of our office,” referring to the decision, later overruled by the Supreme Court, to charge some rioters with obstructing Congress.“We have a lot of people in the Republican Party who are very nervous of conflict, but he has a reputation of not being afraid of conflict,” said Suzzanne Monk, founder of the J6 Pardon Project, which pushed for full pardons for all January 6 defendants. “Let’s see how much teeth that investigation has, and how much of a leash that President Trump gives his pit bulls.”Martin’s actions in a matter of weeks on the job won him a place on Bondi’s newly named Weaponization Working Group, according to a person briefed on the discussions. The purpose of the group is to look into allegations that the Biden administration acted inappropriately in pursuing investigations of the January 6 US Capitol riot and Trump.A DC resident, Monk praised Martin for putting a focus on crime in DC instead of January 6 cases. She said she noticed that “his posts on Twitter are about actually prosecuting crimes in DC instead of prosecuting January 6ers.”Among other posts, Martin recently shared an image of his new iPhone wallpaper: a picture of a 3-year-old girl who was fatally shot in southeast DC last year.Political career in MissouriOver the years, Martin has also tried his hand at electoral politics, without success.In 2010, a Republican wave year, he tried to unseat Democratic Rep. Russ Carnahan, with support from Tea Party groups, but lost the St. Louis-area seat by about 2%. Martin then ran for Missouri attorney general in 2012, challenging incumbent Democrat Chris Koster. The race wasn’t close: Martin lost by 15%, in part because he fell short in traditional GOP areas.He became the chairman of the Missouri Republican Party in 2013 and was at the helm for two years. In a series of op-eds, he bashed the GOP establishment “racket” and candidates like Scott Walker and Jeb Bush in the 2016 primary, and argued that the professional class of GOP consultants “hate the populist energy that Mr. Trump is capturing.”Martin has worked closely with Phyllis Schlafly, a fellow Missourian and one of the most prominent women in the conservative movement. He led the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, an activist group that says it fights for “pro-family” values and opposes “radical feminists.”During Trump’s first campaign, Martin and Schlafly co-wrote “The Conservative Case for Trump,” which was published after her death in September 2016. The book was a watershed moment for Trump as he courted support from the religious right and conservative women.Hardliner against abortionAs a conservative radio host, Martin espoused extreme anti-abortion views that go far beyond any policies that Trump has proposed, according to reporting last year from CNN’s KFile.An examination of dozens of episodes of Martin’s radio show from 2022 to 2024 found that, among other things, he has suggested that there could be criminal punishments for women who get abortions. “Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,” he once said.He has publicly called for a national abortion ban without exceptions for rape and incest. In one radio show, he reiterated his opposition to any exceptions by singling out the case of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio who was raped in 2022. He said: “I have said over and over again the examples that shouldn’t be the rule, right? You can’t let the exceptions be the rule.”Martin also falsely claimed that medically induced abortion and birth control pills were “damaging” and dangerous for women. He has falsely claimed it was “an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother,” despite medical findings that abortions can be necessary to treat life-threatening pregnancy complications.Obsessed with leaksWithin the US attorney’s office, Martin has already become infamous for his near-daily emails to the entire staff, which are sometimes riddled with typos and angry outbursts over leaks.After one of his emails leaked during his first week in office, Martin complained, “Wow, what a disappointment to have my email yesterday to you all was leaked almost immediately. Again, personally insulting and professionally unacceptable. I guess I have learned my lesson (‘Fool me once…’).” That email was subsequently leaked to CNN and other media outlets.Many in the office have also picked up on Martin’s heavy presence on X.Earlier this month, Martin publicly posted a letter that he sent to Musk, pledging to prosecute anyone who doxes or threatens staffers from Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. This came after news reports identifying DOGE staffers who were involved in disruptions and firings at key agencies like the Treasury Department and the US Agency for International Development.“We will chase them to the end of the Earth to hold them accountable,” Martin wrote, adding, “Noone (sic) is above the law.”",cnn,POSITIVE,0.7116203308105469
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/eric-adams-charges-dismissal-hearing/index.html,2025-02-19 16:38:00,Eric Adams case: Judge doesn’t immediately rule on DOJ’s push to drop corruption charges against NYC mayor after hearing,"New York Wednesday’s much anticipated hearing on the Justice Department’s motion to dismiss the case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams has ended without an immediate ruling from Judge Dale Ho.Ho said he was not going to “shoot from the hip” on the bench, just before adjourning the hearing.The DOJ move to end the case against Adams prompted an exodus of prosecutors who disagreed with the decision. Eight federal prosecutors, including the interim US attorney for the Southern District of New York, have resigned in protest. Four deputy mayors have departed City Hall as well.Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who sat alone at the prosecution table, argued the case should be dismissed without prejudice, meaning it could be revived, because of “appearances of impropriety and risks of interference with the 2025 elections in New York City” and because continuing the case would “interfere with the defendant’s ability to govern in New York City” and threaten President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.“Frankly, I think the fact that Mayor Adams is sitting to my left right now is part of the problem. He’s not able to be out running the city and campaigning, so I think that this motion is actual interference,” Bove said in court on Wednesday.It is “undisputed that there is no quid pro quo,” Bove said. He also added that it’s irrelevant whether there was a quid pro quo, because it wouldn’t affect the legality of the motion to dismiss.In court, Adams’ attorney Alex Spiro said suggestions of any quid quo pro between Adams and the Trump administration are false and said “it never happened.”Judge Ho asked Adams a series of routine questions about his mental state and understanding of the situation before finding him competent to voluntary consent to the motion to dismiss the charges.The courtroom was packed with onlookers, including Todd Blanche, who is Trump’s pick for deputy attorney general, and James Dennehy, the top agent at the FBI’s New York field office whose agents investigated Adams.Adams, who consented in writing to the deal, also denied any “quid pro quo” with the administration for dropping the charges of bribery, corruption, wire fraud and soliciting and accepting donations from foreign nationals in exchange for boosting Trump’s immigration agenda.During the hearing, the mayor stood, raised his right hand, and took an oath to tell the truth. He acknowledged that the Justice Department could bring back the charges at a later date, but said he doesn’t believe it will.“I have not committed a crime,” Adams said. “I don’t see them bringing it back. I’m not afraid of that.”When asked, Adams also said he hadn’t been promised anything to consent to the motion – and he had not been threatened into consenting to the motion.Bove also added at one point, unprompted, “I want to be clear I think the only question is whether there’s any basis to believe that I made these representations to the court in bad faith, and the answer to that is absolutely not.”Judge Ho, who spent nearly an hour in court questioning Bove about the DOJ rationale for dropping the case, said he understands his discretion as to the motion is “narrow.”Ho pressed Bove on whether the Justice Department had ever dropped other cases on the rationale put forward. Bove said he was not aware of a case involving a public official but said there were instances where prosecutors did drop charges for “significant foreign policy interests.”The judge also asked how far the Justice Department’s theory would go – hypothetically the judge asked if it would apply to a police commissioner charged with public safety and national security interests or a governor of a border state.“Absolutely,” Bove replied.Bove also drew a parallel to Trump’s federal indictment tied to January 6, where a judge granted a motion to dismiss the case without prejudice.“If that was OK, there is no basis to question my representation today,” Bove told the judge.Ho remarked, “This is a very complicated situation, at least from where I sit.”If Ho were to reject the motion to dismiss the case against Adams, there’s little precedent of what happens next. The judge had scheduled the hearing amid growing calls from top Democrats for the embattled Democratic mayor to step down or be removed from office and as former prosecutors urge the judge to not approve the dismissal without digging deeper into the circumstances surrounding the deal.The Justice Department has moved to dismiss the case under Rule 48(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which says the government may “with leave of the court” dismiss an indictment.“It’s not in anyone’s interest here for this to drag on, I understand that it’s not in the government’s interest, it’s not in Mayor Adams as the defendant, and it’s not in the public’s interest,” the judge said as the hearing ended.“But to exercise my discretion properly, I’m not going to shoot from the hip right here on the bench,” he added. “I want to take the time that is necessary to carefully consider everything that you have put before me and said today, and I am considering all of that. I want to make sure that I consider everything appropriate and that I don’t consider anything inappropriate, and make a reasoned decision that is mindful of my role, which I understand here, is quite narrow.”This story has been updated with additional developments.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9951531887054443

It’s above 50%,"Washington President Donald Trump’s false declaration Tuesday that Ukraine “started” the Russian war on Ukraine generated the most attention. But Trump also made another wildly inaccurate assertion about Ukraine during those remarks to the media at Mar-a-Lago: a claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has a 4% approval rating.Trump was pushing Ukraine to hold its first presidential election since Zelensky was elected in 2019. The Ukrainian constitution does not allow national elections under martial law; Ukraine, which has been under martial law since the Russian invasion in 2022, called off the presidential election that would otherwise have been held in 2024.When Trump was asked Tuesday if the US would ever support a reported Russian demand “to force Ukraine to hold new elections in order to sign any kind of a peace deal,” Trump responded, “Well, we have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine; where we have martial law, essentially martial law, in Ukraine; where the leader in Ukraine, I mean, I hate to say it, but he’s down at 4% percent approval rating.”Facts First: Trump’s claim is not even close to accurate. Zelensky’s approval rating is far higher than 4%. In fact, it has been above 50% in major recent surveys.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Zelensky described Trump’s “4%” claim as disinformation from Russia. Wherever Trump got the number – the White House didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment – it is detached from reality.Keith Darden, an American University professor who studies Ukraine, told CNN on Wednesday that a poll this month from “the best and most reliable survey organization in Ukraine,” the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, found that 57% of Ukrainians trusted Zelensky. (Darden said, “They do not ask ‘approval’ ratings, but about ‘trust’ in leadership. In Ukrainian, it’s very similar to approval,” referring to a “kind of trust that they are doing a good job in their role.”)The new poll was published after Trump made his “4%” claim – but the organization’s previous poll, from December, found that 52% of Ukrainians had trust in Zelensky. And that was Zelensky’s lowest trust figure in the organization’s polling since the Russian invasion in February 2022.Olga Onuch, a University of Manchester professor who conducts public opinion research in Ukraine with other academics, told CNN on Tuesday that their latest survey, conducted from November 22 of last year to January 7 of this year, found that “63% of Ukrainians either approve fully or tend to approve of Zelensky’s actions as president.” She said their survey was also performed by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics and Ukraine’s economic minister in 2019 and 2020, told CNN on Tuesday, “We have never seen anything close” to a 4% approval rating for Zelensky. Mylovanov said Zelensky’s lowest approval ratings were in 2021, but even then were much higher than 4%. He pointed to one late-2021 survey that found approval of Zelensky at about 26%.Zelensky’s popularity skyrocketed early in the war in 2022, when polling found 90% of Ukrainians said they trusted him. It has since fallen significantly. But Trump didn’t merely claim Zelensky has a lower approval rating than he used to.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9981125593185425
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/fact-check-trumps-lies-about-zelensky-and-ukraine/index.html,2025-02-19 18:54:00,Fact check: Trump’s barrage of lies about Zelensky and Ukraine,"Washington President Donald Trump is on a lying spree about Ukraine.In remarks to reporters on Tuesday and in a social media post on Wednesday, Trump made numerous false claims about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Russian war on Ukraine – some of which echoed inaccurate talking points from Russian President Vladimir Putin.Here is a fact check of some of his assertions.Who started the warSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump dismissed Ukraine’s complaints about its exclusion from US-Russia talks on ending the war – and falsely said of Ukraine: “You should’ve never started it. You could’ve made a deal.”Ukraine did not start the war. Russia started the war by invading Ukraine in 2022. Trump’s own former vice president, Mike Pence, and several Republican lawmakers have noted this obvious fact in the wake of Trump’s lie.Zelensky’s approval ratingIn the same Tuesday remarks, Trump called for a new Ukrainian election – last year’s previously scheduled presidential election was called off because the country is under martial law – and falsely claimed Zelensky is “down at 4% percent approval rating.”That 4% figure is not even close to accurate.The latest survey from a leading Ukrainian pollster, conducted earlier this month, found that 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelensky. That was up from 52% in December – and 52% was Zelensky’s lowest wartime figure in this series of trust surveys. In addition, an approval survey conducted from late November to early January found 63% of Ukrainians either approved fully or tended to approve of Zelensky’s actions as president.US wartime aid to UkraineIn the Wednesday social media post, Trump falsely claimed that Zelensky “talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars” to “go into” an unwinnable war.The $350 billion figure, too, is far from reality.According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine, the US had committed a total of about $124 billion in military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between late January 2022, just before the Russian invasion, and the end of December 2024; the think tank found the US had actually allocated about $119 billion.It’s possible to arrive at different totals using different counting methodologies, but there is no apparent basis for Trump’s “$350 billion” figure. The US government inspector general overseeing the Ukraine response has said on its website that “as of September 30, 2024, the U.S. Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion, with $130.1 billion obligated and $86.7 billion disbursed” – and that includes funding spent in the US or sent to countries other than Ukraine.US aid vs. European aidIn both the Tuesday remarks and the Wednesday social media post, Trump returned to his familiar but false claim about a supposedly massive disparity between the amount of Ukraine aid provided by the US and by Europe.He said Tuesday: “I think Europe has given $100 billion and we’ve given, let’s say, $300-plus (billion).” He wrote Wednesday: “The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe.”Neither of those statements are accurate.In fact, according to the Kiel Institute’s data, Europe – the European Union plus individual European countries – had collectively committed far more total wartime military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine through December (about $258 billion) than the US committed (about $124 billion). Europe had also allocated more military, financial and humanitarian aid (about $138 billion) than the US allocated (about $119 billion).The US did have a slim lead in one particular category, military aid allocated, providing about $67 billion to about $65 billion for Europe. But even that was nowhere close to the giant gulf Trump described.Zelensky and ‘missing’ aid moneyIn the Wednesday social media post, Trump falsely claimed that Zelensky “admits that half of the money we sent him is ‘MISSING.’” He made a similar claim to reporters on Tuesday.But Zelensky has made no such admission. Rather, he has taken issue with inflated claims about how much US cash Ukraine has received.He said in a February 1 interview with the Associated Press that although people talk about Ukraine getting as much as $200 billion in US aid, Ukraine had received about $76 billion, largely in the form of weapons. Zelensky said he doesn’t know where all the professed additional money has gone and that perhaps these higher figures are correct “on paper,” according to a translation by the news outlet Ukrainska Pravda.Contrary to some viral social media posts this month, that wasn’t a confession that half of the cash that the US sent to Ukraine had vanished. In reality, Zelensky was saying exactly what experts in the US and elsewhere have repeatedly pointed out – that a large chunk of the total US budgetary “response” to the Ukraine war is not in the form of money handed to the Ukrainian government.For example, experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank wrote last May: “The notion of ‘aid to Ukraine’ is a misnomer. Despite images of ‘pallets of cash’ being sent to Ukraine, about 72 percent of this money overall and 86 percent of the military aid will be spent in the United States. The reason for this high percentage is that weapons going to Ukraine are produced in U.S. factories, payments to U.S. service members are mostly spent in the United States, and even some piece of the humanitarian aid is spent in the United States.”In new comments to reporters on Wednesday, Reuters reported, Zelensky said the US has provided about $67 billion in weapons and $31.5 billion in budget support.This article has been updated with additional information.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9989727735519409
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/federal-workers-callous-firing/index.html,2025-02-20 00:44:00,"For many newly fired federal workers, the way they were let go made things much worse","As federal workers get fired by the thousands, the news has sometimes come in unceremonious, callous ways.“Read this immediately,” – went the subject line of a termination email received by one worker. For another, it was the prepaid UPS label that showed up without warning—along with instructions for returning the work computer they were using.These have been some of the impersonal ways workers have discovered their fate.Federal employees who were new to their current job – though not necessarily new to federal work – known as probationary workers, have been a target of the Trump administration’s purge of the federal government, championed by Elon Musk and his DOGE campaign. Now, 72 hours after being purged because they were considered probationary workers, a biting reality has set in for many of them.“I feel like the cruelty is the point, if I am being honest,” a federal worker, terminated on Thursday, told CNN. “There has been so much indication from the new OPM director and Elon Musk and from DOGE that the whole point of this is to scare people away from working in federal government or those who are still there, to want to leave.”CNN spoke to more than a dozen federal workers from numerous federal agencies in the immediate days after the purge.For many, the frenetic nature of the firings has left them confused – and even days later – without a full accounting of their termination.The former workers told CNN their human resources questions are not getting answered: How long they will have health insurance? When is their last paycheck? What about their retirement accounts? And who can they contact for additional information?For Victoria DeLano, her first indication that she was terminated from the Office of Civil Rights at Dept of Education was when she logged on to her computer at home on Wednesday evening and found her government access had been revoked. She reached out to her team leader via text message on her personal phone. Only then, did she get confirmation she had been let go and told her there was no other information to give her.Five days later, she is still without any formal information.“I still have nothing,” DeLano, who is a member of the American Federal of Government Employees (AFGE) union, said. “Nothing about my benefits, nothing official about termination, nothing about severance. I don’t even have a letter of termination to get unemployment.”Beyond just the immediate sting of losing their jobs, recently terminated federal workers tell CNN, it is the callous, impersonal, and chaotic way in which it is happening that is rubbing salt in the wound.Another federal worker said they received a phone call from a supervisor they had never spoken to Thursday night and then access to their computer was revoked within thirty minutes of that call.“It is so careless,” the worker said. “You are telling me I’m terminated immediately. What does that mean for my health care? What happens to my retirement? I don’t have a way to get in touch with anyone. Everyone is locked out. How do you then have a conversation if you are locked out of your system?”“Oh my God – now what?” a recently-terminated federal worker told CNN of their first thoughts after digesting their termination email, which came late Friday night with very limited information on resources that would typically be provided to terminated employees.Among those CNN spoke to – a woman who is six-months pregnant and whose family relies on her health benefits, a disabled federal worker, a primary caregiver for an aging parent and a young couple planning a wedding in the fall. All have now been terminated and are left wondering what impact their firing will have on their life ahead.“There has been absolutely no clarity – there is no articulation what is next,” another recently-terminated federal worker said.“I received no warning. I was immediately locked out of the system. I can’t even access my last paystub,“ a recently terminated worker said.Members of the American Federation of Government Employees union protest against firings during a rally to defend federal workers in Washington, DC on February 11. Anadolu/Anadolu/Anadolu via Getty ImagesSome are wondering how to return government equipment like phones and computers, with those devices still sitting in a lot of the former employees’ homes.“There is no information on these emails,” another recently terminated federal worker said. “This is not only cruel. It is extremely unorganized. They don’t have a plan for returning equiptment. They don’t have a plan for contacting people once they fire them. This is chaos.”In the immediate aftermath, federal employees are sharing tidbits of information that they learn about their agency on the messaging app Signal, on social media and on telephone calls with one another. Some are attempting to pick up the pieces – and trying to move past the confusion and resentment.For one recently fired federal worker who was planning a wedding for the fall, those plans are being reassessed.Among the options - potentially foregoing a honeymoon or reducing the scope of their wedding – with the hopes of not having to postpone the nuptials out right.“Elon Musk is not taking my wedding,” they said wistfully.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.999289870262146
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/hegseth-military-major-budget-cuts/index.html,2025-02-19 18:43:00,Pete Hegseth: Defense secretary orders military to prepare for major budget cuts,"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the military to prepare plans to make drastic budget cuts over the next five years, with an exception for border security, according to a new memo obtained by CNN.The memo, dated Tuesday, calls for military leaders to provide a proposal for eight percent in budget cuts each year for the next five years. The proposals for the massive cuts to the Pentagon’s budget of approximately $850 billion are due by February 24, less than one week after Hegseth issued the memo.It was issued the day before President Donald Trump endorsed the House’s budget plan which includes a $100 billion increase in defense spending, suggesting a major disconnect within the administration. Hegseth himself called for an increase to the defense budget one week ago. While visiting Stuttgart, Germany, Hegseth said, “I think the US needs to spend more than the Biden administration was willing to, who historically underinvested in the capabilities of our military.”“I ask that the Military Departments and DoD Components resource the capabilities and readiness necessary for a wartime tempo and offset those requirements with low-impact items, such as wasteful DEI and climate change programs,” Hegseth wrote in the memo. The memo, which was labeled CUI – controlled unclassified information – was sent to senior Pentagon leaders, the commanders of combatant commands and defense agencies.The memo comes as Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is initiating a major effort to shrink the federal government, cutting spending and laying off a significant number of workers across the country.The Washington Post first reported the memo.“The Department of Defense is conducting this review to ensure we are making the best use of the taxpayers’ dollars in a way that delivers on the President Trump’s defense priorities efficiently and effectively,” said Pentagon spokesman Robert Salesses.Despite Hegseth’s stated focus to “revive the warrior ethos,” some defense officials responsible for drafting lists of civilian Pentagon employees to be fired as soon as this week are voicing concerns that the summary firings could break the law and harm US military readiness.The proposed cuts to the Pentagon’s approximately $850 billion budget would amount to tens of billions of dollars in cuts in the first year, the largest reduction in the Defense Department budget since sequestration in 2013.The proposal is certain to meet with resistance from Congressional Republicans, many of whom have called for increasing the defense budget and derided the Biden administration for only modest hikes in defense spending. Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has called for defense spending to gradually increase to more than $1 trillion per year.The cuts also come at a time when Trump is calling on NATO allies to increase defense spending to five percent of gross domestic product (GDP), which would amount to a massive hike in spending for nearly every single NATO country. (If the US spent five percent of its budget on defense, the military’s budget would exceed $1.2 trillion.)",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9911879301071167
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/john-thune-senate-trumps-agenda/index.html,2025-02-19 16:29:00,Thune’s power move to advance Trump’s agenda,"Washington Senate Republicans announced Wednesday they are muscling ahead with their preferred legislative strategy to jumpstart Donald Trump’s agenda — just hours after the president himself backed a much different approach.That power move by Senate Majority Leader John Thune is setting up a dramatic clash with House Speaker Mike Johnson when the House returns next week, and possibly with Trump himself, as party leaders attempt to deliver the White House’s ambitious policy goals despite a historically narrow margin in Congress. And it comes with high stakes: Both chambers must agree on an identical approach to unlock the special powers that allow Trump to pass his agenda without the threat of the Senate filibuster — all while facing critical looming deadlines, such as the expiration of Trump’s tax cuts later this year.“President Trump prefers one big, beautiful bill. So do I, but you always have a plan B around here,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. “I am pulling for the House to pull it together and get one big, beautiful bill, but it’s gotta be consistent with President Trump’s tax agenda. Right now the tax agenda is to make the tax cuts permanent, and the House bill doesn’t do that.”Thune declared Wednesday he plans to move ahead this week with plans to complete part one of Trump’s agenda — a budget that directs the Senate to pass border security and energy production — even as Trump himself weighed in to back the House GOP’s far more sweeping approach, which has a slew of plans to pass tax breaks, a temporary debt limit hike and trillions in cuts to federal programs.House Republicans have said they need to cram everything into a single bill or risk missing key deadlines, like the one for tax reform or the spring debt limit. But Senate GOP leaders have said the priority should be to deliver Trump a win and money for his priorities quickly.The internal GOP dispute, which has been raging for months now, is over more than just tactics: It’s a sign of the anxiety by many Republicans, particularly in the Senate, that Trump’s full agenda may not pass the famously-erratic House. And it’s becoming an early test of how the Hill GOP’s relatively green leadership — Thune and Johnson — can corral their razor-thin majorities to work with an emboldened Trump and his aggressive plans to transform Washington.Senate Republicans insisted their approach is necessary – and even acting as a motivator – for House Republicans as they struggle to coalesce behind a single plan that can get 218 votes. Johnson and his leadership team plan to pass their own budget blueprint next week, but they have little room for error and even one or two absences can scramble their plans.“They have come as far as they have come because of feeling that pressure from us and we’d be silly to stop that momentum now,” Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, said.“If the House can’t get their one bill through, I am for whatever can get 218 votes in the House, 51 votes in the Senate, and get signed by the president of the United States,” Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming told reporters. “Everything else is just about the tactics of how to get that done.”Thune’s decision to press forward, however, puzzled some in the conference, including Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri who questioned the wisdom of going through an hourslong vote-a-rama full of tough votes for the party on a budget blueprint that Trump hasn’t even endorsed. The Senate will begin that marathon series of votes Thursday evening, and it is expected to last through Friday morning.“I am a little baffled by what we are doing to be honest,” Hawley said, adding he was not committed to voting for the budget until he had “some assurance” from the president that Trump was backing it. “It just seems a little bizarre to me. I can’t quite figure out what we are doing.”Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also said he will not back the plan because of concerns over the nation’s debt.And it wasn’t immediately clear what would ensue if both chambers successfully passed their respective budget plans. Asked by CNN what would happen if both the House and Senate passed different budgets, GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin replied: “We pass that, and then we start doing the hard work.”Thune’s decision to power ahead comes after Senate Republicans huddled with Vice President JD Vance for over an hour in the Capitol, where the vice president took questions from across the GOP conference on everything from the budget to the debt ceiling. Vance did not advise the Senate against moving ahead with their own budget plan, and senators left believing Trump wouldn’t be opposed even though he prefers the House plan, according to GOP senators in the room.Vice President JD Vance, center, arrives for the Senate Republican policy luncheon at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Wednesday. Allison Robbert/Bloomberg/Getty Images“The president likes the idea of the two-prong approach; that this is not a competition, that the House and Senate are different. The president still prefers a single bill. Frankly, so do I, but he recognizes we need to have a backup plan, and we’re going forward,” said Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, summing up Vance’s message.The House is out on recess this week away from Washington as the Senate moves to advance their plan, but House leaders are warning they won’t cede ground when they get back. Leaders are spending the week whipping votes and trying to unite the caucus around the plan, but there are several conservatives in the GOP who have voiced skepticism that the House bill makes enough cuts – and some in the House have also said they prefer a two-bill strategy. House leaders have tried to rally their conference from afar with Republican Leader Steve Scalise posting on X Wednesday, “the House Republican Budget Resolution implements President @realDonaldTrump’s FULL America First Agenda- not just parts of it- and he’s made clear that’s what Congress needs to pass.”Trump himself backed the House GOP’s all-of-the-above approach on Wednesday, weighing in for the first time to praise Johnson’s measure.“The House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, before calling on both chambers to pass the House’s version.But GOP senators warn their bill is insurance for Trump.“We’ve all heard (Trump), but we’re not going to twiddle our thumbs,” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama. “We’re gonna do something to see if, if theirs falls in, then we’ll have something prepared.”CNN’s Ted Barrett, Morgan Rimmer, Manu Raju and Jenna Monnin contributed to this report.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.5244078040122986

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.President Donald Trump defended the US taking part in peace talks that excluded Ukraine by rewriting history.Speaking to reporters at Mar-a-Lago after a round of golf on Tuesday, Trump argued that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky “should never have started” the war, adding, “You could have made a deal.”Say what you want about the many billions in US military aid for Ukraine or which countries the US should be allied with, there’s no realm of reality, except the one pushed by Russia, in which Zelensky started the war that began in February 2022 when Russian forces invaded Ukraine.Now, after nearly three years of a brutal war of attrition, Zelensky could not get a seat at table for the talks hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and featuring representatives from Putin’s regime, which has been in power for the past 25 years, spanning six different US presidencies.Zelensky tried to pierce Trump’s alternative facts from a press conference of his own Wednesday morning in Kyiv.Video Ad Feedback Zelensky: ‘Trump lives in this disinformation space’ 00:50 - Source: CNN Zelensky: ‘Trump lives in this disinformation space’ 00:50“Unfortunately, President Trump – I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us – unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,” Zelensky said.Later on his social media platform, Trump aped Kremlin talking points, called Zelensky a “dictator” and baselessly alleged that half of the aid okayed by Congress to help Ukraine has gone missing.In reality, more than half the US aid to Ukraine has been in the form of weapons systems and ammunition from US stockpiles. The money went from US taxpayers to US-based defense contractors to buy the weapons and equipment for America’s military inventory, and some of that stockpile was then sent to Ukraine.This may feel like a pivotal moment as Trump leans toward Russia and away from Ukraine.But it comes in the context of Trump’s remarkable political comeback despite being investigated for his 2016 campaign’s interactions with Russians and impeached for his pressure on Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden before the 2020 election that Trump tried to overturn and still won’t admit he lost.In other words, there is history. It’s worth looking taking a quick look back at the last decade.What was happening 10 years ago?In 2015, as he was running for president, Trump was also pursuing the possibility of a real estate deal in Moscow, although the proposal was scrapped, CNN has reported.While there was not enough evidence for the subsequent special counsel Robert Mueller to conclude there was collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russians, Russia actively tried to help Trump win, according to US intelligence assessments, which Trump now dismisses as the “Russia Hoax.”When Trump publicly asked Russians to get Hillary Clinton campaign emails, they immediately started trying, according to indictments filed by the Department of Justice in 2018.Trump’s campaign chairman for a short time during the 2016 campaign, Paul Manafort, had a history of doing work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, which was among the reasons he ultimately left Trump’s campaign.What happened during Trump’s first term?Too much to recount here. Suffice it to say that Russia cast a very long shadow over Trump’s time in office, beginning with the firing of his first national security adviser over lies he told about meeting with the Russian ambassador at the time, the recusal of his first attorney general, the appointment of former FBI director Robert Mueller to investigate Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election, the multiple trials of Trump associates, including Manafort, and much more.Where does Ukraine come in?As part of an effort to dig up dirt on Biden in 2019, Trump pressured Zelensky, then newly in office, to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid to stand up to Russia. That call led to a whistleblower report and Trump’s first impeachment, although he was acquitted of “high crimes and misdemeanors” in a Senate trial.In this 2019 photo, President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky look on during a meeting in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesZelensky, at least until Wednesday, has gone out of his way to praise Trump. The two met in New York in September.But this all brings us to the very odd current dynamic: The foreign leader who Trump may blame for an impeachment is the same one who is getting billions of dollars in US military aid to fight off the foreign leader who US intelligence agencies believe tried to help get Trump elected in 2016. Follow?What does Trump say about Putin and Ukraine?Trump likes to brag that Putin took four years off from his designs on Ukraine when Trump was in office. It’s true that Putin’s Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, when President Barack Obama was in office, and tried to finish the job in 2022, when President Joe Biden was in charge.Trump’s prediction during the 2016 campaign that Putin would not go further into Ukraine if Trump was in office came true.Other predictions, like his boast during a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris last September that “I will get it settled before I even become president,” have not come true.What did Trump say when Putin invaded Ukraine?Trump had called Putin savvy and praised his strength even as Putin was amassing troops on the border of Ukraine. At the time, the Biden administration was trying to convince the world to believe US intelligence that Putin was serious about an invasion and Russia was looking for an excuse to justify one.Trump called in to Fox News and argued, as he continues to argue today, that it was Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan that made Putin move on his desire to invade Ukraine. Trump does not mention that Biden’s Afghanistan plan was originally hatched during Trump’s own administration.For a refresher of what was happening almost exactly three years ago when Russia invaded Ukraine, read CNN’s report from that day. In it, Russia’s spokesman argued the invasion was part of an effort to “liberate” Ukraine,” which needed to be “cleansed of Nazis.” Zelensky, for the record, is Jewish.What are other Republicans saying now?Video Ad Feedback Two GOP senators rail against Putin despite Trump’s rosy assessment of Russian leader 01:04 - Source: CNN Two GOP senators rail against Putin despite Trump’s rosy assessment of Russian leader 01:04In the years since the invasion, many Republicans have largely gravitated to Trump’s way of thinking. Some defenders of Ukraine, like then-Sen. Marco Rubio, have evolved. Rubio is now Trump’s Secretary of State and took part in those Saudi Arabia peace talks. Other Republicans, like Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, still hold an anti-Russia viewpoint, but the party is clearly reorienting itself around Trump’s way of thinking.Will Putin stand down under Trump?Wendy Sherman was a State Department official in the Biden administration who was involved in talks with Russia before the 2022 invasion. In an interview Wednesday, Sherman told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour it’s clear Putin still has designs on claiming Ukraine as part an effort to reconstitute the Russian empire.“He believes it ideologically. He believes it historically, and I don’t think he will settle for anything other than a chance to ultimately take all of (Ukraine),” she said, criticizing Trump for heaping concessions on Putin and normalizing relations between the US and Russia in favor of a peace deal.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.880997896194458
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/splc-immigration-lawyers-layoffs-trump-crackdown-invs/index.html,2025-02-19 18:00:00,"In lead-up to Trump crackdown, an iconic civil rights group fired all the attorneys in its unit defending undocumented migrants","Isabel Zelaya was beginning his shift at a beef slaughterhouse in rural Tennessee on a spring day in 2018 when agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement burst into the processing area and, with guns drawn, ordered him and others to toss their tools to the ground.Zelaya, who was in his 60s at the time of the raid, explained that he had legal status to live and work in the US, but agents nonetheless zip-tied his hands and led him into a van, according to court records.He and about 100 other Latino workers were shuttled to a nearby National Guard Armory for processing.The operation, at the time the largest workplace immigration raid in at least a decade, sent a signal that then-President Donald Trump’s tough talk on illegal immigration would be matched by hard-nosed action.The move triggered a swift response by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a civil-rights nonprofit with a long history of using the legal system to defend vulnerable groups.Days after the raid, the Alabama-based organization dispatched a team of lawyers to the small towns where the workers lived and were being detained.The attorneys from SPLC and the National Immigration Law Center would spark a flurry of legal activity that included a successful wage-theft complaint against the meatpacking plant and a precedent-setting class-action suit – with Zelaya as the named plaintiff – that led to a nearly $1.2 million settlement with the feds for racial profiling and excessive force. It was thought to be the first class action settlement against the US government tied to a workplace immigration raid, experts said.Now, with Trump back in the White House after having promised during the campaign to unleash “the largest deportation operation in American history,” the cadre of attorneys at SPLC who amounted to a first line of legal defense for undocumented immigrants is no more.This past summer, in a move that inflamed already raw tensions at the storied civil rights institution, the SPLC laid off all 35 staffers – 23 of them lawyers of various specialties – in its Immigrant Justice Project, former employees said. (SPLC confirmed that the program was terminated but declined to provide specific figures.) That immigration division, in the words of the organization, took on “cases that few private lawyers will accept, seeking systemic reforms and representing victims of injustice.” The layoff was part of a larger restructuring effort at the well-funded organization.Esmeralda Baustista holds a photograph of her brother, Luis Bautista-Martinez, who was among the workers detained when ICE raided the cattle slaughterhouse in Tennessee. Saul Young/Knoxville News Sentinel/USA Today Network/Imagn ImagesA CNN review of the work of SPLC’s immigration program found that it played a key role in holding ICE, privately run detention centers, and employers of undocumented immigrants accountable, particularly in the southeast region, which is home to some of the nation’s largest and most troubled detention facilities.SPLC’s now-disbanded Immigrant Justice Project also had a large subsidiary unit – called the Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative (known internally as “SIFI”) – that provided free legal representation to undocumented immigrants held in detention. That unit of immigration attorneys enabled hundreds of detainees to be released on bond while their immigration or asylum cases were tried, thereby enhancing their chances of success, former employees and SPLC officials told CNN.Above all, immigration advocates say, the attorneys had a watchdog effect on a system of confinement that can be walled off from public view.“SPLC is an immensely resourced group,” said Lisa Graybill, who used to work at SPLC and is now vice president of litigation and legal strategy at the National Immigration Law Center. “The loss of those resources and that partnership is really significant.”SPLC officials insist they fully intend to continue serving the immigrant community. They characterize the cuts as a reorganization that will replace a case-by-case approach with a big-picture strategy that addresses abuses at the systemic level.“We plan on focusing on broad, systemic issues that have maximum impact for immigrant communities,” Derwyn Bunton, the SPLC’s chief legal officer, told CNN. “We organized our resources into larger, issue-focused legal teams. And this strengthens our ability to help bring challenges to unjust immigration policies and practices across our entire practice at the local, state and federal levels.”Asked whether SPLC plans to hire new attorneys to beef up its roster, Bunton was non-committal.As it stands now, the organization has no immigration attorneys, though Bunton said it has attorneys with immigration experience and will not shrink from combating the Trump administration’s plans for mass deportations.“As the threat has scaled up, so have our efforts to pursue litigation against them by shifting to more broadly challenging unfair and discriminatory legislation and policies,” he said.Bunton declined to share specifics on immigration suits or initiatives in the works, saying they are in the “investigation phase.”SPLC leaves large void in immigration advocacyThis past summer, SPLC shed 78 jobs, or about a fifth of its staff, in its restructuring efforts. While the round of layoffs touched multiple departments, none were wiped out as thoroughly as the Immigrant Justice Project.The mass layoff reverberated throughout the nation’s network of immigration-focused nonprofits.Michael Lukens, the executive director at the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights based in Washington, DC, said the size of the void left by SPLC’s dismantled program can’t be overstated – particularly in southeastern states like Georgia and Louisiana.“The thought of having some of the largest detention centers in the country with nobody outside of a few local nonprofits doing the work that SPLC was doing is really troubling,” said Lukens, whose organization provides some individualized representation for detainees in Georgia but whose main focus is on Maryland, DC and Virginia.Meanwhile, Lukens added, the second Trump administration’s immigration policies and rhetoric are even more hardline than the first.“It’s a lot crueler this time,” he said. “And it’s also a lot more xenophobic and outwardly hateful.”A detainee sits in a holding cell at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. David Goldman/APSPLC’s pullback coincides with a sense of public exhaustion on the left that stands in contrast to the full-throated opposition to Trump’s election in 2016. That fatigue has taken tangible form in donation dollars, which, by some accounts, haven’t exactly flooded the coffers of nonprofit civil-rights groups in the same way they did in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s first win.“There was a massive mobilization of people during Trump 1.0 and it seems like that’s slowly picking up steam, but I do think people are somewhat tired,” Lukens said. “It’s hard to get everybody as motivated as they were the last time.”Publicly available tax documents show that SPLC, like other nonprofits, witnessed a surge of donations around the time of Trump’s first election. In 2017, the group launched the “SIFI” unit that provided pro-bono legal services to detainees in Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi; it included about nine immigration attorneys, former employees said.All of them were laid off in June.10 deaths since 2017Among the immigrant lockups served by the SPLC attorneys was the Stewart Detention Center, a remote facility in Lumpkin, Georgia, that has gained notoriety for its harsh conditions. It has seen 10 deaths since 2017, the highest in the nation, according to a June ACLU report.Immigration advocates say in addition to providing legal aid, SPLC’s attorneys had a daily presence in the Stewart facility that was itself a safeguard against abuses and unsafe conditions, which have allegedly included significant mold growth, food-poisoning due to spoilage, medical neglect and excessive use of solitary confinement, according to a December report by El Refugio, a nonprofit that provides assistance to detainees at Stewart.A spokesperson for CoreCivic, the private company that runs Stewart, disputed the claims in the report, saying the facility is audited regularly without notice.“Facility conditions at (Stewart) are evaluated and inspected on a weekly basis, including sanitation practices, HVAC and plumbing systems, food service equipment, and overall security,” the spokesperson said in an email. He added that the food service at Stewart recently earned a perfect rating from the state.Stewart is currently the third-largest detention facility by population of the 90-plus across the country, according to a research group from Syracuse University.By providing legal aid to detainees at that and other complexes, the SPLC attorneys filled a gap in the immigration system, which, unlike the criminal justice system, does not guarantee legal representation. This means the vast majority of undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers go without it. (Unlike prison inmates, detainees in immigration detention centers can typically be released if they agree to return to their home countries.)Across the country, detainees are given a list provided by the Justice Department of organizations that provide pro-bono legal assistance; at Stewart in Georgia, the SPLC’s group was often the only one on it, immigrant advocates say. The American Bar Association does offer services, but they are generally educational.“I honestly don’t have any other numbers to give them right now,” said Amilcar Valencia, the executive director at El Refugio, which provides lodging at a house near the Stewart facility for people visiting detainees. He said he worries the situation at Stewart is about to become “chaotic.”“It’s just going to be a lot for the loved ones to just even locate their family members, let alone trying to find legal support,” Valencia said.Former SPLC employees say in 2023 they were able to help nearly 100 detainees from Stewart get released early on bond; the facility typically holds about 1,875 ICE detainees.SPLC officials have indicated that this is too much effort for too little payoff. Margaret Huang, the CEO of SPLC, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution this past summer that the individualized approach was like to “trying to empty the ocean with the teaspoon.”By focusing more on class-action cases, Bunton of SPLC said the organization can help immigrants beyond the confines of what happens in the immigration courts.“With immigrant communities it’s going to be what happens in the streets in their towns throughout the South; it’s going to be what happens to their families, to housing, to all these sorts of things,” he told CNN.But attorneys who were laid off insist that meeting with individual detainees at the detention centers sometimes led to bigger cases or produced valuable intel for them.“You can’t just show up somewhere and gain everyone’s trust and have them tell you these really difficult stories that could put themselves at risk without having built those relationships for a long time and gained trust and promise to stay with them,” said Erin Argueta, the lead SPLC immigration attorney at Stewart until she was laid off; she now works for another immigration-oriented nonprofit.Layoffs exacerbate internal turmoil at SPLCInternal tensions at SPLC have been brewing since at least 2019, when staff turmoil led to the ouster of its co-founder, Morris Dees, now 88.The organization fired Dees after he was investigated twice for “inappropriate conduct” and 20 employees sent a letter to executives claiming that the SPLC’s moral authority had been compromised by allegations of “mistreatment, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and racism.”Dees, who denied wrongdoing, had enjoyed a celebrated career that included a lawsuit in the 1980s against a large and violent Ku Klux Klan outfit that left the white supremacist group bankrupt. Reached by phone, Dees declined to comment for this story.SPLC’s effort to unionize was born amid the 2019 staff revolt against Dees, said Rachel Janik, a union officer at SPLC.“It brought the people together who would become our organizing committee,” she told CNN.Members of the SPLC union hold a protest over what they said was unfair working conditions outside the Southern Poverty Law Center headquarters in Montgomery, Alabama, in 2022. Jake Crandall/Montgomery Advertiser/USA Today Network/Imagn ImagesSPLC officials say the organizing effort had nothing to do with who it decided to let go last summer.But Janik said the layoffs “really struck at the heart of our union.”“They laid off our unit chair,” she said, adding that more than 60 union members were terminated. “Multiple officers were laid off. A ton of stewards were laid off.”Both sides, however, agree that the layoffs had little to do with finances.Indeed, the Southern Poverty Law Center remains a fundraising powerhouse. Its total revenue in 2023 – nearly $170 million, most of it from contributions but much of it also from investments – surpassed the prior year’s intake by about $30 million, according to its latest publicly available tax filings. The organization’s ever-growing store of total assets that year came to nearly $750 million.As part of its reorg, SPLC has identified five key areas of focus for litigation moving forward: economic justice; voting rights; democracy, education and youth; inclusion and anti-extremism; and decarceration and decriminalization.Immigration matters, SPLC officials said, could fall under any of those pillars.But advocates worry that the lack of boots on the ground at detention centers in the southeast will have harsh effects for many individuals who – like many of the slaughterhouse employees in Tennessee – get swept up in the raids.“They will not be able to find an attorney to help them,” Lukens said. “They won’t be able to seek bond. They won’t be able to really fight their case.”Tania Wolf, who was laid off from her SPLC position in Louisiana as a senior project coordinator in the immigration program, was more blunt.“It’s going to lead to increased amounts of suffering for people in detention,” she said.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9221738576889038
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/steve-witkoff-ukraine-israel-negotiations/index.html,2025-02-19 13:28:00,"How Trump friend Steve Witkoff ended up at the center of high-stakes Ukraine, Israel negotiations","When Donald Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts by a jury last May, there was one person in his courtroom entourage who wasn’t one of his lawyers, aides or family members: Steve Witkoff.While a parade of Trump allies came in and out of the Manhattan courtroom throughout last year’s seven-week trial — including Trump’s eventual vice president, JD Vance — it was Witkoff who stayed by Trump’s side during the final hours after two days of jury deliberations, a sign of the close friendship between the two real estate moguls.Now that longtime friendship with Trump has thrust Witkoff in the middle of two of the biggest foreign policy crises facing Trump’s second term. Named Trump’s Middle East envoy shortly after the president won a return to the White House in November, Witkoff worked with Biden administration’s officials to finalize a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.His portfolio has now expanded to the Russia-Ukraine war, and Witkoff accompanied Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, for a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday that served to jumpstart US-Russian relations.US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud, National Security Advisor Mosaad bin Mohammad al-Aiban, the Russian president's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attend a meeting together at Riyadh's Diriyah Palace on February 18. Evelyn Hockstein/Pool/Getty ImagesWhile Witkoff has never served before as a diplomat or even worked in government, Trump views him as the ultimate dealmaker.“Outside of family, there is no one as trusted by DJT as Steve,” a White House official told CNN.‘A politer version of Trump’During Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, Witkoff served as Trump’s de facto personal diplomat, facilitating talks with several of Trump’s top Republican rivals. In the first month of Trump’s second term, Witkoff has traveled the globe on Trump’s behalf — often in his own private jet. He met with world leaders — including Russian President Vladimir Putin — helped secure a prisoner swap with Russia and was the first US government official to visit Gaza in years.People who have attended meetings with Witkoff describe him as good-natured but to-the-point — “a politer version of Trump,” one person said, with a sense of how to wield leverage in ways that can ease some certain tense negotiations.Sources close to Trump say the president has long believed he forged his negotiating skills through his real estate career. Trump sees the same qualities in Witkoff, viewing the two as being cut from the same cloth. That shared experience is something virtually no one else in the Trump administration possesses.Witkoff also has a leg up over other high-ranking Trump officials in that he knows how Trump operates. And his long friendship with Trump gives Witkoff the benefit of longevity to keep his seat at the negotiating table even as Cabinet secretaries and other top Trump officials may come and go, like they did in Trump’s first term.While Witkoff was in the room Tuesday alongside the secretary of state and national security adviser, Trump’s Russia-Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, was notably absent. Sources who have spoken to Kellogg about the situation believe that he has been sidelined from any discussions with Moscow because of his more hawkish views on Russia, including pushing for continued US military aid to Ukraine and security guarantees to help Kyiv negotiate from a position of strength.Two sources said the Russians have indicated they would rather negotiate with Witkoff than Kellogg.The White House pushed back on that assertion, with one official telling CNN that Kellogg has instead been tasked by Trump to focus on negotiations with Ukraine and the United States’ European allies. Kellogg is in Kyiv this week meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.The learning curve will be steep in trying to bring an end to the three-year Russia-Ukraine war, veteran foreign policy hands say, with a negotiation that threatens to upend the US role in the world and the US-European relationship amid fears Trump is cozying up to Putin.“Whether or not Witkoff is going to be the main guy in a Russia-Ukraine negotiation, it’s a different sort of lift from the one he’s currently involved in in the Middle East.” said Aaron David Miller, a seasoned Middle East negotiator who worked for multiple US administrations.“He’s yet to be tested on this,” added Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “When it comes to Russia and Ukraine, it’s not like developing a piece of property or a shopping center. This is politically existential — and for Zelensky it’s even more than just politically existential.”Meeting at a New York deliThe road to Witkoff’s role negotiating some of the world’s biggest diplomatic crises began with a ham and Swiss sandwich at 3 in the morning.Witkoff has described in court how he and Trump first met at a New York delicatessen early one morning around 1986 when he was a lawyer. Witkoff testified on Trump’s behalf in November 2023 during at Trump’s civil fraud trial, where the New York attorney general was seeking hundreds of millions of dollars alleging Trump and his company inflated the value of his assets to obtain more favorable loan and insurance rates.“He didn’t have any money with him, and I was ordering from a local delicatessen for the people who were on my team,” Witkoff said. “And he asked me if I would order him a ham and Swiss sandwich. So that was the first time I met him.”Years later, Witkoff said, he saw Trump again at a restaurant. “He actually remembered who I was and remembered the sandwich incident. And had just developed a friendship as a result of it,” Witkoff said while on the stand.Trump and Witkoff, who transitioned his law career into running a lucrative New York real estate company, remained friends over the past two decades. They stayed close throughout Trump’s political rise in 2016, his brief political exile in 2021 and his triumphant return last year.Witkoff’s son Zach got married at Mar-a-Lago in 2022. Unlike many Mar-a-Lago weddings that feature a quick drop-in by Trump, at this event the former (and future) president stayed well into the evening with his wife, Melania.During Trump’s 2024 campaign, Witkoff was already acting as an unofficial envoy to Trump’s rivals for the GOP nomination. Witkoff arranged a meeting between Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in April 2024. And Nikki Haley described on her radio show how Witkoff came to her house in South Carolina to ask what she wanted for a truce with Trump.The real estate mogul was also crucial to helping get Trump elected. Not only did he donate millions of dollars to Trump’s campaign and outside political organizations, but he also helped facilitate meetings and fundraisers with other wealthy donors who helped fuel Trump’s victory.Witkoff was on the links with Trump in in September when a would-be assassin hid in the bushes outside Trump’s Florida golf course, the second assassination attempt on Trump’s life last year.“All of a sudden we heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five, and it sounded like bullets,” Trump later said of the incident. “But what do I know about that? But Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me, and I think probably the other one, Steve is one of the people. Steve Witkoff, a great friend of mine.”A rare partnershipWitkoff didn’t serve a formal role in Trump’s first administration. But a week after Trump won back the White House in November, he named Witkoff as special envoy to the Middle East.President Donald Trump shakes hands with Steve Witkoff as they as they welcome Marc Fogel back to the United States after being released from Russian custody at the White House on February 11 in Washington, DC. Al Drago/Getty ImagesAs a Jewish real estate magnate, and a businessman with international financial dealings, Witkoff already had existing relationships with Israelis, something people close to Trump described as the reasoning behind why he was initially tapped for the role.At the start of this year, Witkoff found himself at the center of perhaps the only area of cooperation between the incoming and outgoing administrations: brokering a ceasefire deal in Gaza that, for months, had eluded President Joe Biden and his team.His presence in Doha during the final days of the talks — and earlier in Israel, when he sat for a rare Saturday meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — was met with some initial skepticism by some of Biden’s aides in Washington, who predicted it would allow Trump to take credit for a deal (in that, they were correct).Yet it quickly became clear to Biden’s own negotiating team that Witkoff was as serious-minded and helpful in the talks as any seasoned diplomat, even amid eleventh-hour setbacks. Working into the early morning hours to finalize text of the agreement, Witkoff sometimes arrived to negotiating sessions in sneakers and sweatpants.One senior Biden official described the partnership between Witkoff and Brett McGurk, his counterpart in the Biden administration, as “historically almost unprecedented” and “a highly constructive, very fruitful partnership.”“Steve and I developed a very close partnership, even friendship, and at the time to close the deal, I was very grateful that Steve came out to Doha in these last few days,” McGurk told CNN last month.Another person familiar with the discussions in Israel and Qatar said while Biden’s team was there to manage the specifics of the arrangement, Witkoff acted as a reminder that Trump wanted the deal completed before he entered office.Later, Israeli officials said Witkoff — and, by extension, Trump himself — were the deciding factor that put the deal over the finish line.After the ceasefire took effect and hostages began being released from Gaza, Witkoff returned to Israel, meeting with Netanyahu about the next phase of the agreement ahead of Netanyahu’s White House meeting with Trump.Witkoff also traveled to Gaza, the first US official to do so in years. When he returned to Washington, Witkoff gave Trump a dire impression of the devastation he witnessed. He told reporters that he viewed it as being no longer habitable.Witkoff’s descriptions were an “inflection point” for Trump, a White House official told CNN, and the president subsequently proposed removing Palestinians from Gaza so it could be rebuilt — a plan sharply rebuked by Arab leaders.Witkoff was dispatched to Capitol Hill to field questions behind closed doors from Republican senators concerned about Trump’s Gaza plans, and he defended Trump’s ideas publicly.“When the president talks about cleaning it out, he talks about making it habitable. And this is a long-range plan,” Witkoff told reporters at the White House earlier this month.Trump asks, ‘and we say yes’Witkoff’s next assignment took him out of the Middle East and into the US government’s highly adversarial relationship with Russia.“Witkoff proved early on that he had the chops to be a dealmaker. He helped reach a breakthrough where others couldn’t. That success led the president to give him more jobs,” a Trump administration official said.Witkoff was sent to Russia to try to negotiate the release of Marc Fogel, an American teacher who had been wrongfully detained for three years. When he arrived on the ground in Russia, a deal wasn’t yet in place. “There was still work to do,” Witkoff would say later.While in Moscow, Witkoff met directly with Putin, as well as Kirill Dmitriev, a close Putin adviser who played a significant role in the Fogel talks, Witkoff said. The Middle East envoy also credited the role that Saudi Crown Prince Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman played in the talks as “instrumental.”Witkoff was on the ground for six or seven hours in Russia, and he left Russian airspace with Fogel on his plane, returning the American prisoner to the US.Upon his return, Witkoff repeatedly gave Trump credit for the deal and thanked the president for empowering him to be the conduit — a sign of Witkoff’s experience in dealing with Trump.“In general, with President Trump, he asks, and we say yes,” Witkoff told CNN the day after Fogel’s release.The next day, Trump spoke with Putin by phone, setting the stage for Tuesday’s talks between the US and Russian delegations. The move angered Zelensky and America’s allies in Europe, who felt they were being shut out and feared what Trump would agree to.While Witkoff and other top Trump officials traveled to Saudi Arabia for talks with the Russian delegation, Kellogg was dispatched to Kyiv Wednesday, where he is expected to meet with Zelensky. Rather than engaging in negotiations, Kellogg will undoubtedly be left to deal with any fallout from the US-Russia meeting and Trump’s recent public attacks on the Ukrainian president.At the conclusion of Tuesday’s meeting with Lavrov, Witkoff had nothing but good things to say about the discussion. “It was positive, upbeat, and constructive, everybody there to get to the right outcome. Solution-based. We discussed it afterwards. We couldn’t have imagined a better result after this. It was very, very solid,” he told reporters.What happened next underscored the challenge ahead for Witkoff and the US team preparing to negotiate with Russia: Trump attacked Zelensky and falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia.“I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it’s going well. But today I heard, ‘Oh well, we weren’t invited,’” Trump told reporters Tuesday afternoon at Mar-a-Lago. “Well, you’ve been there for three years. You should’ve ended it after three years. You should’ve never started it. You could’ve made a deal.”CNN’s Zachary Cohen, Natasha Bertrand and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",cnn,POSITIVE,0.9928343296051025

Bush appointee – said that a closer review of the case will move forward in its court, with arguments slated for June.The case before the San Francisco-based appeals court is one of several major legal challenges to the policy and the first to get the weigh-in by an appellate panel.In filings, the Justice Department said that the birthright citizenship executive order was “an integral part of President Trump’s broader effort to repair the United States’ immigration system and to address the ongoing crisis at the southern border.”For decades, under an 1868 constitutional amendment and a statute that preceded it, citizenship has been extended to anyone born on US soil, regardless of the immigration status of their parents. Trump is seeking to end birthright citizenship for children whose parents are either undocumented or are lawfully present in the United States on temporary visas.The 9th Circuit case arose from a lawsuit filed by the Democratic attorneys general of four states led by Washington. Their filings pushed back on the DOJ’s efforts to frame the dispute around a president’s powers in the immigration sphere.“This is not a case about ‘immigration,” they wrote. “It is about citizenship rights that the Fourteenth Amendment and federal statute intentionally and explicitly place beyond the President’s authority to condition or deny.”The majority of the 9th Circuit panel indicated that the Trump administration had failed at this emergency phase because it had not shown it that it was likely to succeed on the merits of the dispute.Judge Danielle Forrest, a Trump appointee, wrote a concurrence stating that she was not expressing any views on the underlying legal arguments, and that instead she had voted against the Trump administration because it had not shown that there was an “emergency” requiring an immediate intervention of the court.“Deciding important substantive issues on one week’s notice turns our usual decision-making process on its head,” she wrote. “We should not undertake this task unless the circumstances dictate that we must. They do not here.”This story has been updated with additional details.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9968106150627136
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/trump-supreme-court-immunity/index.html,2025-02-19 17:00:00,The Supreme Court gave Trump immunity. He’s using it as a blank check.,"President Donald Trump has expounded an extraordinary vision of his authority over the past month, relying on the Supreme Court’s decision last year granting him immunity from criminal prosecution as a blank check in his broader drive for power.Trump’s personal lawyers and his Justice Department have wielded the case in several major filings, including over the ban on TikTok and in new Supreme Court arguments to justify the president’s firing of an official who runs an independent agency.The latter case, centered on Trump’s February 7 removal of the head of a watchdog agency, will mark the first Supreme Court test of Trump’s second-term agenda.Justice Department lawyers opened their filing on Sunday with an ambitious reference to Trump v. US as they argued neither Congress nor federal judges may interfere with Trump’s power to get rid of appointees of a former president.“This case involves an unprecedented assault on the separation of powers,” DOJ wrote as it appealed a lower court order that would let Hampton Dellinger remain at the helm of the independent agency that protects whistleblowers.“As this Court observed just last Term, ‘Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions on subjects within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority’ — including ‘the President’s unrestricted power of removal with respect to executive officers of the United States whom (the President) has appointed,’” the Justice Department added.Trump’s arguments in cases parallel his Oval Office declarations regarding the scope of his power, as he signs scores of executive actions and boasts of his ability to define the law.“He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” Trump asserted in a social media post on Saturday.Since he won a second term last November, such muscular assertions have played out in his policy and personnel decisions, as well as his legal stances.“Everything Trump is doing is in service of a principle that he has read into the Constitution which would make the president all powerful and unaccountable for the exercise of his powers,” said University of North Carolina constitutional law professor Michael Gerhardt. “But that is inconsistent with the Constitution’s principle that no one is above the law.”Bessent v Dellinger Vacatur Application US Supreme Court“And they are now completely misquoting and misunderstanding Trump v. US,” Gerhardt added. “It’s ultimately about a president’s personal liability under the law.”The 6-3 decision on immunity arose from Trump’s efforts to avoid criminal prosecution for election subversion tracing to his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. Special counsel Jack Smith had charged the former president with four criminal counts, including that he falsely claimed widespread voter fraud, tried to organize fake slates of electors and encouraged his supporters to march toward the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Five police officers were among the nine people who died in the day’s riots and in the months that followed.In siding with Trump and effectively shutting down Smith’s case before the November election, Roberts declared a presumptive immunity from prosecution for official acts. He reinforced the majority’s view by highlighting the broader dimensions of presidential authority, for example, over foreign affairs and appointments, which Trump’s lawyers have employed in new cases.Trump’s personal lawyer will now represent his Justice DepartmentLawyer D. John Sauer represented Trump in the case that led to the Supreme Court’s sweeping July 1 decision giving him personal immunity from prosecution.Sauer remained Trump’s lawyer, and before Trump took office last month, Sauer touted his personal and presidential capabilities in the TikTok case. Sauer urged the justices to postpone action on the controversy over the popular social media platform headquartered in Beijing until Trump was again in the White House.“President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government – concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,” Sauer wrote in a filing to the Supreme Court that repeatedly referred to Trump v. US.Sauer will remain in the fold. Trump has nominated him to be solicitor general – the government’s top lawyer at the Supreme Court.Trump’s private team separately in January pointed to Trump v. US as it claimed a Manhattan trial judge wrongly determined Trump should be sentenced for his earlier May 2024 conviction in the New York hush money case. Trump’s lawyers said the Supreme Court’s decision should have shielded him from any proceeding during the period of presidential transition, between the election and his inauguration.As Sauer awaits a Senate hearing, acting solicitor general Sarah Harris has shepherded the Dellinger controversy.Biden appointed Dellinger and he was confirmed by the Senate in March 2024 to a five-year term. After Trump fired him this month, Dellinger sued, arguing that the law governing his appointment says he may be dismissed only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”Lower courts have sided with Dellinger in preliminary hearings. But the conservative high court has in recent years given the president greater authority to remove individual heads of independent agencies.Harris has cited those decisions in her request to the justices that would allow Dellinger’s removal – but only after using Trump v. US to underscore the urgency of the president’s position.Preventing the president from removing an appointee who is not his choice, Harris wrote, “inflicts the gravest of injuries on the Executive Branch and the separation of powers.”TikTok v Garland Amicus Brief US Supreme CourtHer overall message: While the dispute involves a small government agency, the stakes are massive for Trump’s early agenda.More relevant to the dispute at hand, Harris noted that twice in the past five years the justices struck down limits on the president’s ability to remove officials serving as the sole head of an executive agency.In those 2020 and 2021 cases, involving directors of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the justices said protections for those officials violated the president’s constitutional authority.Dellinger’s lawyers on Tuesday urged the justices to allow him stay at his post while letting lower court judges continue their review of the merits of the case. Referring to a federal judge’s temporary restraining order permitting Dellinger to keep his job as the case proceeds over the next week, his lawyers wrote, “There is no merit to the government’s effort to declare a five-alarm fire based on a short-lived TRO.”Justices unmoved thus farIn the TikTok case, the justices were unmoved by Trump’s plea for any delay and let the ban be enforced on January 19. The next day, after officially returning to the White House, Trump instituted a 75-day pause on the ban against the popular social media platform with a Chinese parent company.The justices also in January allowed his Manhattan sentencing to go forward. The 5-4 majority noted that the trial judge had said he would be imposing no penalties or prison time.Trump v New York stay application US Supreme CourtAs much as the administration’s new submission in the Dellinger case accentuates the stakes of a president’s constitutional authority, Harris closed by stating that her position is actually quite limited.“(I)n the weeks since the President’s current term began,” she wrote, “district courts have issued multiple TROs that block the President’s policies throughout the Nation, sometimes even throughout the world. Although the government firmly believes that those TROs exceed district courts’ lawful authorities, it has thus far sought the Court’s intervention only in this case – because this TRO intrudes so deeply into the President’s Article II powers.”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.872331440448761
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/trumps-executive-order-independent-agencies/index.html,2025-02-19 16:14:00,What to know about Trump’s executive order and ‘unprecedented’ power grab within the government,"President Donald Trump’s executive order grasping far greater control over independent federal agencies embraces a constitutionally questionable theory that presidents dating back to Ronald Reagan have considered – and ultimately rejected.In a far-reaching executive order Tuesday, Trump demanded that the White House review regulations at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies with sweeping power to shape everything from shipping lanes to nuclear power plants.The order is part of a broader push by Trump to consolidate power over independent agencies that Congress intended to be removed from presidential control. It follows a series of controversial firings at those agencies that are being challenged in federal courts, including at the Supreme Court.Here’s what to know about Trump’s latest executive order:Why it mattersCongress passed laws setting up independent agencies because lawmakers wanted the government to be able to perform some functions – like overseeing elections or regulating financial markets – without direct presidential involvement.The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, has in recent years required publicly traded companies to provide additional information to regulators about their internal policies. The Federal Trade Commission enforces antitrust law. And the Federal Election Commission enforces federal campaign finance laws, such as donation and spending limits.But support for independence has smacked up against a theory long popular within conservative legal circles that a president should have near complete control over the executive branch and the people who work in it. It is a theory that has increasingly found purchase on the 6-3 conservative Supreme Court.“For at least a century, we’ve all thought that certain types of federal agency actions should be removed from politics to the extent we can,” said Christopher Walker, a University of Michigan Law School professor and an expert in administrative law.The question of whether Trump’s move is unconstitutional or unlawful has long been an open one, Walker said.“Personally, I don’t think so,” he said. “But is it a big change? Absolutely.”How Trump’s plan would workFederal agencies, generally, must submit proposed regulations to the Office of Management and Budget, a part of the White House. That includes government entities like the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation as well as the Pentagon. When President Ronald Reagan formalized that process in the early 1980s, his administration considered requiring the same sort of review for independent agencies.Ultimately, the Reagan administration decided against it.Trump’s own Department of Justice considered the question during his first administration, in 2019, and concluded nothing stood in the president’s way.Still, the administration didn’t pursue the policy at that time.Trump’s new order requires a huge swath of independent agencies to submit regulations for review. In explaining the order, the White House said that those and other independent agencies exert “enormous power over the American people without presidential oversight.” The agencies, it said, “issue rules and regulations that cost billions of dollars and implicate some of the most controversial policy matters.”Public Citizen, a progressive advocacy group, has called the move “illegal” and a “giant gift to the corporate class.”“This is a profoundly dangerous idea for the nation’s health, safety, environment and economy – and for our democracy. Congress made independent agencies independent of the White House for good reason,” Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, said in a statement.Beyond the technical requirements involving regulation review, Trump’s order also mandates far more day-to-day involvement by the White House in the business of independent agencies. The order requires liaisons from the White House to those agencies and insists that its leaders “regularly consult with and coordinate policies.”“That’s pretty unprecedented,” said Daniel Walters, a Texas A&M University law professor and expert on administrative law. “This seems to suggest a real interest in reining in independent agencies.”Several independent agencies contacted by CNN on Wednesday, including the SEC and the FEC, declined to comment.Tied to firingsThe order follows – and is closely tied to – a push by the White House to remove the leaders of some independent agencies, including those who are empowered to criticize the president’s agenda.The Supreme Court is already considering the case of Hampton Dellinger, the special counsel, who Trump fired this month. Dellinger, named to the job by President Joe Biden, handles allegations of whistleblower retaliation within the federal government. Dellinger’s agency could potentially slow Trump’s effort to dramatically cut the size of the federal workforce.(The office is unrelated to special counsels like Jack Smith or Robert Mueller who were appointed to oversee politically sensitive investigations for the Justice Department.)Congress included protections for the post, requiring a president to show “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office” before firing the special counsel. Trump cited none of those reasons for Dellinger’s dismissal and his Justice Department recently asserted that the requirements Congress enacted are unconstitutional.The Supreme Court could rule on a preliminary question in that case at any time.Trump has fired other independent agency heads in similar positions, as well. A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the White House from dismissing the chair of the federal Merit Systems Protection Board.Another federal court is reviewing Trump’s dismissal of a member at the National Labor Relations Board.The lawsuits challenging those dismissals rest in part on a foundational Supreme Court precedent from 1935, Humphrey’s Executor v. US, that allows Congress to require presidents to show cause – such as malfeasance – before dismissing board members overseeing independent agencies.But the Supreme Court’s conservative justices have distanced themselves from that decision in recent years, most notably in a 2020 decision involving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In that case, Seila Law v. CFPB, the court held that protections for the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau violated separation of powers principles. That controversial agency, originally envisioned by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, was created in response to the 2008 financial meltdown and it has approved consumer-friendly regulations on mortgages, car loans and credit cards.The president’s power to “remove – and thus supervise – those who wield executive power” flows directly from the Constitution, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.“The CFPB director has no boss, peers, or voters to report to,” Roberts wrote. “Yet the director wields vast rulemaking, enforcement, and adjudicatory authority over a significant portion of the US economy.”Eyes on the FedTrump’s order notably excluded much – but not all – of the Federal Reserve from its requirements. During his first term, Trump frequently sparred with the agency’s leadership over interest rates.The Fed, experts say, illustrates why Congress has long wanted to create independent agencies. If a president had complete control over the Fed’s monetary policy, he could demand lower interest rates to give the economy a jolt during an election year, even if that decision has adverse consequences, like higher inflation, months after the election.By skirting around the Fed, the White House is attempting to avoid a legal confrontation that might go too far for a conservative Supreme Court.But, legally, experts say, there’s little to distinguish the Federal Reserve from the other independent agencies Trump has targeted with the order.Walker stressed that there is significant benefit to having the Office of Management and Budget review government regulations, particularly in checking the process agencies used to draft them. It’s another set of eyes to review what are often complicated policies with huge implications for the nation.“I’m a fan of this move, from a bureaucracy perspective,” Walker said. “What worries me is presidential politics. I don’t want the process to be politicized.”Who defines the law?One section of Trump’s executive order appeared to encompass more than just independent agencies – and it was drawing considerable scrutiny from some of the president’s critics on social media.Tucked into the order is a section that suggests the president and attorney general “shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch.” Some read that language to suggest that he, alone, would interpret the law.Trump may like that idea – he recently asserted on social media that, “he who saves his country does not violate any Law” – but an executive order does not carry the force of law and so it changes nothing about the checks and balances set out in the Constitution.What the White House appeared to be aiming at in the order is the idea that independent agencies should be interpreting the law consistently with the rest of the administration. In the case of Dellinger, for instance, that has not happened.“The President and the Attorney General (subject to the President’s supervision and control) will interpret the law for the executive branch, instead of having separate agencies adopt conflicting interpretations,” the White House said in a fact sheet explaining that provision.CNN’s Kit Maher and Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9931325316429138

It’s also the first iPhone with a cellular modem designed by Apple, and the cheapest iPhone Apple currently sells that supports Apple Intelligence.The iPhone 16e costs $599 and launches on February 28.Adding Apple Intelligence on a cheaper iPhone could be crucial for putting the company’s AI tools in the hands of more consumers. Apple has faced increased competition from Google and Samsung in recent years, both in the budget smartphone market and in the AI space. Google’s cheaper Pixel A-series of phones have been well received, for example, and both Google and Samsung have prioritized updating Android devices with new AI features over the last year.The launch also marks a shift away from the iPhone SE, the budget iPhone line Apple debuted in 2016 and last updated in 2022. The iPhone SE made up only a sliver of Apple’s iPhone market share, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which reports it accounted for just 5% of US iPhone sales as of December 2024.The iPhone 16e, despite being more expensive than the SE, could be more appealing to those who want a device that feels more like Apple’s more recent phones. The iPhone SE was the last iPhone with a traditional home button and fingerprint sensor on the front, a longtime staple that Apple began shifting away from with the iPhone X in 2017.Apple CEO Tim Cook teased the launch in a social media post on February 13, saying a new “member of the family” would arrive on February 19.Apple announced the iPhone 16e on February 19. AppleWhat the iPhone 16e can doApple claims the new 5G modem in the iPhone 16e is the “most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone.” The new modem is arriving more than five years after Apple acquired the majority of troubled chipmaker Intel’s smartphone modem business in 2019. Using its own modems makes Apple less reliant on partners and suppliers, giving it more control over product development and launch timing.The iPhone 16e marks a long-awaited overhaul to Apple’s cheaper iPhone. The $429 iPhone SE, while less expensive, looked like the seven-year-old iPhone 8 and lacked features found on most new phones, such as face unlock and a nearly borderless screen. After Wednesday’s announcement, the iPhone SE is no longer available on Apple’s online store.Unlike the iPhone SE, the iPhone 16e has a lot in common with the iPhone 16, bringing it up to speed with Apple’s current lineup. Both phones have a 6.1-inch screen, Face ID, a 48-megapixel camera and the Action button for programming shortcuts. However, the iPhone 16e is cheaper and it lacks a dedicated second camera for capturing wider shots and the Camera Control button for quickly accessing the camera.It’s powered by the same processor as the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup, enabling it to run Apple Intelligence.Apple Intelligence, which until now has only been available on the iPhone 16 family, 2023’s iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and certain iPads and Macs, is a blanket term that refers to a handful of AI-powered tools – such as the ability to generate emojis and images with a prompt, summarize notifications, and remove objects from photos as well as ChatGPT integration with Siri.The popularity of ChatGPT following its late 2022 release sent a shockwave through the tech industry, prompting companies such as Microsoft, Google and Samsung to incorporate generative AI into their products.But Apple was largely considered to be a latecomer to consumer-facing artificial intelligence. Like many tech companies, Apple has long used AI to power backend features, like camera modes, but didn’t begin rolling out Apple Intelligence until last fall. Apple Intelligence’s arrival on a cheaper device like the iPhone 16e signals the company sees AI as being a core part of its products moving forward.Tech giants have positioned generative AI and chatbots as the next major evolution in how consumers use and interact with technology. Yet it’s unclear whether AI tools like Apple Intelligence will be compelling enough to drive smartphone upgrades, with Apple’s iPhone revenue falling short of Wall Street’s expectations in its fiscal first quarter of 2025.This story has been updated with additional developments and context.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.987514853477478

The plot allegedly included plans to assassinate Moraes, who blocked Bolsonaro’s party request to overturn the 2022 election results. Bolsonaro, who has denied knowledge of the assassination plans, has accused Moraes of political persecution, not only targeting himself but also conservative voices in the country for ordering the shutdown of hundreds of social media accounts.Moraes has also clashed with X owner and top Trump donor Elon Musk. X had been suspended in Brazil, one of its largest and most-coveted markets, in late August after not complying with court orders from Moraes related to hate speech moderation and failing to name a legal representative in the country, as required by law. Musk called Moraes a “dictator” and called the orders censorship, but Musk later complied with the court orders and X came back online in Brazil in October.Daphne Keller, who teaches internet law at Stanford University, told CNN the Trump Media case is the first she’s seen of its kind.“They’re asking for two things. One is for the court to confirm that there is no way that the order is enforceable in the United States,” Keller said. “The other thing they’re asking for is they want an American court to order a Brazilian supreme court justice to not do something, to not ask app stores to remove Rumble and Truth Social – something I’ve never seen before.”While the complaint brings up important and interesting points of First Amendment rights and global law, it may be mostly for show, Keller said, considering there’s no way US law enforcement would carry out a foreign court’s order.“It’s kind of performative to make a lot of noise about free speech and file this case when the thing you’re asking for isn’t going to do you any good,” she said.Keller said that while the complaint addresses a significant issue – a judge trying to enforce a global takedown – the courts may not be the right venue.“I don’t think going to US courts is a way to fix this – a normal administration would call for diplomatic response or trade responses … rather than going to court,” Keller said.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9783923625946045

Can Beijing turn things around?,"Hong Kong Inbound investment in China plummeted to a four-year low in January, as the world’s second-largest economy grapples with a flurry of headwinds.The Ministry of Commerce reported on Wednesday that 97.6 billion yuan ($13.4 billion) in foreign direct investment was utilized last month, a 13% drop from the same period last year.The weak start to the year came after a steep plunge of 27.1% in total annual foreign direct investment (FDI) last year to 826.3 billion yuan ($113.4 billion). It was the lowest figure since 2016.“The decline has narrowed compared to last year, but it is still on a downward trend,” Ling Ji, China’s vice commerce minister, said at a Thursday press conference, where multiple government departments unveiled a 20-point action plan to attract foreign capital.Ling attributed the sluggish foreign investment to a slow global economic recovery, rising geopolitical tensions and protectionism. Shifts in multinational businesses’ strategies have also led to a decline in foreign investment in China’s key industries such as automotive, machinery and apparel, he said.The sputtering property sector has dragged down economic growth and weighed on consumer spending. At the same time, in sectors such as automobiles and consumer products, foreign brands face intense competition from increasingly popular national champions due to technological advancement and rising patriotic sentiment.China has repeatedly sought to woo foreign investment, an important driver for economic growth. The new action plan would further open up the economy, improve regulatory support and attract long-term investment in China’s publicly listed firms, Ling said.Beijing promised to expand a pilot program giving full foreign ownership in sectors like telecommunications, health care and education. It also vowed to formulate new policies to encourage reinvestment by foreign enterprises within the country, and lift restrictions on the use of domestic loans by foreign firms.The exodus of foreign capital is an indicator of the country’s deepening economic problems. The challenges facing China’s economy are all but certain to increase as growth slows, leaving Beijing with far fewer potential countermoves in its toolbox against a second Trump term.Since returning to office, the US president has wasted no time in reigniting old trade tensions. Earlier this month, he enacted a 10% across-board-tariff on imports from China, to which Beijing has responded with targeted economic measures. Observers say it is still possible the two sides may hammer out a broader trade agreement at the negotiation table.An annual survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China published last month found over half of US businesses expect worsening bilateral relations, with a record 30% considering or already moving operations out of ChinaMeanwhile, the diversification of supply chains beyond China sparked by the trade war that began during US President Donald Trump’s first term has been accelerated by the Covid-19 global pandemic, which caused disruptions for firms with manufacturing bases in the country.Additionally, rising political tension in China has made investment in the country less attractive. A slew of tightened state security-related legislation and counterespionage laws introduced in the past few years have rattled foreign businesses, with the detention of foreign executives and employees raising concerns among the business community.",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9977902173995972

He’s not going to have a country left.”Both accusations parroted Moscow’s own irony-laden talking points about the war and Ukraine’s president, who declared martial law at the onset of Russia’s invasion, which prevented scheduled elections.Trump’s post was hardly an isolated attack. For years, Trump has viewed Zelensky skeptically, questioning his decisions and — in an episode made famous during Trump’s first impeachment — pressing him to open an investigation into his then-rival Joe Biden.Trump has taken to weaving his criticism of Biden and Zelensky together, suggesting Wednesday night that the Ukrainian president was on a “gravy train” with US assistance during the Biden administration.“If you would have had (Biden’s) administration for another year,” Trump said Wednesday night, “you would have been in World War III and it’s not going to happen now.”Lately, however, Trump’s aides have been closely monitoring Zelensky’s public statements — in particular his criticism of the US excluding Ukraine from talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia this week — with mounting agitation.Their frustration had been growing before Wednesday, the sources said. But it boiled over after Zelensky told reporters at his office in Kyiv that Trump was living in a “web of disinformation.”Trump privately told aides who were with him in Florida that he wanted to respond directly, which led to his Truth Social post, an official traveling with Trump said. He delivered the diplomatic missile on the way to his golf club in Miami and expanded on his remarks before an audience of hundreds at the evening investment conference in Miami sponsored by the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, which hosted talks earlier in the week between US and Russian officials.“It’s a frustration. There is a strong and legitimate feeling that this brutal war has to stop and that this pathway is being diminished through Zelensky’s public statements,” a second White House official told CNN.In Zelensky’s view, however, the end to the war Trump is envisioning looks a lot like what Russia has been asking for. Already, members of Trump’s administration have ruled out NATO membership for Kyiv and said US troops would not help guarantee Ukraine’s security when the war ends.For those reasons, he says he can’t help but speak out.For months, Zelensky had carefully sought to avoid a full rupture with his temperamental new counterpart in Washington. He arranged a meeting in the weeks ahead of last year’s election meant to allay some of the then-GOP nominee’s skepticism about US involvement in the war.The men emerged at the start of the discussion at Trump Tower in Manhattan to demonstrate their willingness to get along. Trump said he had a “very good relationship” with the Ukrainian leader — but that he also enjoyed a “very good relationship” with his adversary in Moscow, Vladimir Putin.“I hope we have more good relations,” Zelensky interjected.“But, you know, it takes two to tango,” Trump replied.At the time, the exchange hardly registered. Five months later, it appears to foretell the remarkable rift that is emerging just as Trump looks to sit down with Putin in Saudi Arabia.Signaling a shift in American policyFew foreign leaders have been immune to Trump’s mood swings, which during his first term led to scrapped overseas trips, phone calls ended abruptly when Trump hung up, and the imposition of tough new tariffs.Yet until now, Trump’s frustrations hadn’t seemed to signal such a wholesale shift in American foreign policy, away from the United States’ longstanding allies in Europe and toward the Kremlin.Many of Trump’s allies said Zelensky should have seen Trump’s wrath coming.“The idea that Zelensky is going to change the president’s mind by badmouthing him in public media, everyone who knows the president will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration,” Vance told The Daily Mail.In explaining Trump’s striking public statements, White House officials have insisted his primary – in fact, only – objective is to end the three-year conflict in Ukraine, which he believes was woefully mismanaged by the previous administration.Insisting upon a settlement to the war, they say, is long overdue after years of grinding conflict. Trump himself has appeared almost agnostic on the precise contours of the settlement that would end the war: “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed, killed,” he said last week.Yet how he achieves that objective while castigating Zelensky and aligning himself with Russian talking points isn’t clear.Trump’s Republican allies in Washington suggested Wednesday the president may have a grand plan in mind.”What I’m in support of is a peaceful outcome and result in Ukraine,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said when asked if he had concerns about the president’s rhetoric about Ukraine. Thune said he believed Trump and his team are working to achieve peace and “right now, you’ve got to give them some space.”Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, said Trump is “always positioning for something,” adding that he suspected Trump might be “positioning for a negotiation” with Putin through his comments about Zelensky.Still, Trump will require buy-in from Zelensky if any negotiated end to the conflict is successful. And if he is serious about keeping American troops out of the conflict, he’ll need European allies to step up with their own peacekeeping troops — a step some nations have already offered.Some Trump advisers and allies do see a strategy in the bluster. A Trump loyalist who has spoken to the president in Florida in recent days said one reason behind Trump’s lashing out at Ukraine is to scare Europe into ponying up more to defend Ukraine.“See, there’s a method to the madness,” the person said, pointing to a report that Denmark had pledged to boost spending on arms.A Trump advisor echoed that sentiment on Wednesday, telling CNN: “If other European countries are half as responsive as Denmark, then that’s a massive win.”Writing on X, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson — who maintained close ties with Trump during his first term — rebutted most of Trump’s claims but said his former counterpart was driving a larger point.“When are we Europeans going to stop being scandalised about Donald Trump and start helping him to end this war?” Johnson wrote. “Of course Ukraine didn’t start the war. You might as well say that America attacked Japan at Pearl Harbor. Of course a country undergoing a violent invasion should not be staging elections. There was no general election in the UK from 1935 to 1945. Of course Zelenskyy’s ratings are not 4%. They are actually about the same as Trump’s.”“Trump’s statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action,” he went on.Indeed, hastily arranged conferences of European leaders in Paris this week hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron suggested Trump’s words were being taken very seriously.“Russia poses an existential threat to Europeans,” Macron said in an interview with French regional newspapers. “Do not think that the unthinkable cannot happen, including the worst.”At the same time, Macron is not giving up on Trump entirely. He will be in Washington next week for a meeting, as will British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has said he would be willing to send troops to act as peacekeepers in Ukraine.Both men spoke to Zelensky on Wednesday following Trump’s insults.“The Prime Minister expressed his support for President Zelenskyy as Ukraine’s democratically elected leader and said that it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War II,” Downing Street said afterward.Trump is increasingly casting himself in the role of peacemaker – no matter the cost – overlooking the frayed western alliances and the upending of US foreign policy.“We’re successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia, something all admit that only Trump is going to be able to do,” Trump said Wednesday night, speaking about himself again and again in the third person.“In the Trump administration, we’re going to be able to do it. I think Putin even admitted that.”",cnn,NEGATIVE,0.9884266257286072
