More below.Separately: You might recall that several years ago I wrote a series of columns, following a raft of mass shootings, that inspired the creation of a “merchant category code” for gun retailers so credit card companies could better identify suspicious activity the way they already did to help prevent money laundering and sex trafficking.Well, this week Representative Riley Moore, Republican of West Virginia, introduced a bill to make it illegal for credit card companies to require “merchant category codes that distinguish a firearms retailer from general-merchandise retailer.” That means gun retailers would be able to mask what they sell.

The president and his team describe the tax as giving other countries an unfair trade advantage over the United States.Here’s what to know.What is a value-added tax?It’s a consumption tax that adds tax on a good or service at each stage of production. The final VAT is the sum of the tax paid at each stage. This system is unlike a sales tax in the United States, which is imposed by states on the final sale of the good.In Europe, VAT rates vary by country, but on average are about 20 percent — far higher than state sales taxes in the United States, which averaged 6.6 percent in 2023, according to the Tax Foundation.",New York Times

Business Leaders Are About to Find Out.,"“Traditional uncertainty shocks happened after negative world events,” Mr. Bloom said. “In this case, it’s almost like a deliberate move to surge uncertainty.”That makes it hard to predict how businesses will respond. It is possible, Mr. Bloom said, that they will bet on an easing of uncertainty and will focus on the potential benefits of a Trump presidency. He noted that investors appeared mostly unconcerned by the torrent of news out of Washington: Measures of financial market volatility have generally been docile since Mr. Trump took office.But executives are likely to be cautious about making long-term investments, Mr. Bloom said — particularly those that are hard to reverse, like moving a factory, or that take a long time to pay off, like investments in research and development.Pulling BackMr. Pinchuk, of Snap-on, said he already saw signs of caution among customers, which include both auto repair shops and individual mechanics. They are less interested in buying big-ticket items like tool storage boxes and diagnostic computers that cost thousands of dollars and can take years to pay off. Instead, they are buying less expensive items that they can pay off quickly.“When we talked to them, we could tell that they weren’t going to want to embroil themselves in a three- or four-year payment scheme,” he said. “They prefer to use whatever resources they have to buy stuff where they say, ‘OK, I’ll pay it off in 15 weeks, and then after 15 weeks, I’ll do it again if things are still good.’”",New York Times

That leaves the state unable to force trucking businesses to clean up their fleets. It was a big setback for the state, which has long been allowed to have tailpipe emission rules that are stricter than federal standards because of California’s infamous smog.Some transportation experts said that even before Mr. Trump’s election, California’s effort had problems. The batteries that power electric trucks are too expensive. They take too long to charge. And there aren’t enough places to plug the trucks in.",New York Times

There, one finds his reasoning on a panoply of issues, including military strikes in Somalia, tariffs on Canada and Mexico, relations with Russia, the causes of a deadly aircraft collision, American ownership of the Gaza Strip and a budget bill now before Congress.On Wednesday, for instance, after initial cease-fire talks between the United States and Russia over the war in Ukraine, he employed the account to attack Ukraine’s leader. “Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start,” the president’s post said. “Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.”In some ways, such statements are akin to how Mr. Trump turned Twitter, now called X, into his megaphone in his first term, when administration officials declared his posts to be official White House communications.But one major difference stands out: Mr. Trump is the biggest shareholder in Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that owns Truth Social, and so stands to benefit directly if his posts drive traffic to the site. Even though he has put his Trump Media shares in a trust controlled by his oldest son, the president remains the main draw to the platform that is the company’s signature product.",New York Times

Too many experts will lose their jobs, she said. Mr. Trump, she believes, is making moves that make him seem one step removed from being “a type of dictator.”Ms. Jackont is an educator, a married mother of three sons and an immigrant from Israel. She hoped that Mr. Trump could navigate issues in the Middle East better than his predecessor. But she has watched with bewilderment as he proposed the United States take over Gaza and permanently move the Palestinians living there to other countries.“Not realistic,” she called Mr. Trump’s idea.The president has also threatened “all hell” if every hostage is not released.“It makes me super concerned,” she said. “It makes me feel my heart beat.” If even one of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas is killed because of such rhetoric, she added, “then it does not work for me.”Elon Musk’s influence with the new administration, his access to federal databases, and the lack of transparency surrounding both give her pause. “It’s like airport security,” she said. “You go through the scanners, they see everything. You’re naked before them, and you don’t know what they’re going to do.”Despite her concerns, she still has hope for Mr. Trump’s presidency.

It would be the first substantial talks between the two countries on the conflict, three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion.Mr. Zelensky also said Ukraine had obtained intelligence that Mr. Putin is building up forces for a training mission that resembles the one he held just before the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mr. Zelensky implied, without offering specifics, that the same thing might happen again.The Ukrainian president described his discussions at the Munich Security Conference with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as an initial step. He said Keith Kellogg, the retired general who is Mr. Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, will visit Ukraine this week, as part of an effort by Mr. Zelensky to demonstrate what the battlefield looks like.But he stressed that there was no “real plan” for peace yet, “because they can’t have it without us.” He said it will be up to Mr. Trump to decide what kind of security guarantee Ukraine receives, but he rejected Mr. Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine’s membership in the NATO alliance was not practical.",New York Times

After the plan is approved, it falls to lawmakers on the Appropriations Committees to allocate federal dollars, following the blueprint.Lawmakers in recent years have not produced such a plan or put it to a vote, sidestepping tough decisions about what programs to spend on and what programs to cut. Instead, congressional leaders, in collaboration with senior appropriators, have agreed on the overall numbers and simply passed spending legislation each year.But in order to use the reconciliation process, the House and the Senate must each adopt a budget resolution that lays out broad areas of agreement on where to increase and decrease spending.The budget resolution is just a blueprint. Unlike a spending bill, it does not carry the force of law, and it does not fund the government. Its consideration is entirely separate from another task that Republicans in Congress have in the weeks ahead: agreeing to and passing legislation to keep federal funding flowing past a March 14 deadline.The budget measure being considered this week does not even lay out what specific legislative changes to take in order to meet the spending targets it contains. Those changes must be detailed in separate legislation — one or multiple bills — that is subject to restrictive rules for what can be included and which must pass both the House and Senate to become law.",New York Times

System With Taxpayers’ Records,"The examination of the I.R.S. system represents the latest move by members of Mr. Musk’s team to push the boundaries of access to government data beyond what is typical for political appointees. The Treasury Department has faced questions in recent weeks after lieutenants of Mr. Musk who were assigned to the agency started scrutinizing the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s system, which directs payments across the federal government.Gavin Kliger, a young software engineer who was brought into the Office of Personnel Management as part of the DOGE effort, worked at I.R.S. headquarters on Thursday, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. He will be assigned to the I.R.S. as a senior adviser to the acting commissioner. The tax agency is still working out the exact terms of his work at the I.R.S., though he is expected to have broad access to its systems, according to the two people.As of Sunday evening, he had not yet gained access to sensitive I.R.S. data, the two people said.The Washington Post reported earlier on Sunday that the I.R.S. was considering a memorandum of understanding that would give DOGE staff members broad access to its systems, including the Integrated Data Retrieval System, which contains taxpayer accounts.Attempts by Mr. Musk’s team to gain access to Treasury Department data have faced legal challenges, and efforts to scrutinize I.R.S. systems could encounter a similar fate.This month, 19 state attorneys general led by Letitia James of New York sued to block the Trump administration’s policy of allowing political appointees and “special government employees” led by Mr. Musk access to the Treasury Department’s payment systems. On Friday, a judge extended a court order blocking that access and said she would decide soon whether to keep the restrictions in place until a final ruling was made, which could take months.",New York Times

The words “competence” and “caring” were used repeatedly.And yet, there were occasional moments when Mr. Trump seemed to let on, if only a little, that he was aware that Mr. Musk was playing with fire. “Social Security won’t be touched,” the president promised at one point, adding, “Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.”",New York Times

It does not specify Medicaid policies other than the budget target for the committee that oversees the program. But spending reductions so large would require major changes. Adding a work requirement to the program, a proposal with some public support, would save only around $100 billion.Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, has been warning publicly that cuts to Medicaid could be politically damaging to Mr. Trump and other Republicans. “A lot of MAGA’s on Medicaid,” he said on his “War Room” podcast last week. “You can’t just take a meat ax to it.”And a handful of Republican lawmakers, including a few in the House whose votes Mr. Johnson will need, have begun expressing reservations about big changes to Medicaid.Mr. Trump followed up his comments Tuesday night with a post on social media Wednesday endorsing the House framework. “House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!” he wrote.",New York Times

Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said. “I have reason to believe that the American side started to better understand our positions.”The meeting, the most extensive negotiations in more than three years between the two global powers, was the latest swerve by the Trump administration in abandoning Western efforts to punish Russia for starting Europe’s most destructive war in generations.

And we made the presidency hot, so this should be easy.”The president’s stated reason for the takeover was to rid the center of drag shows that he said targeted young people, which seemed to be a reference to a drag-themed show the center hosted last year, “Dragtastic Dress-up,” aimed at “LGBTQ+ youth under 18,” according to marketing materials.In later comments to reporters on Air Force One, Mr. Trump said that some of the shows at the Kennedy Center “were terrible,” but when asked if he had seen anything there, he said no.Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement on Tuesday that “the Kennedy Center learned the hard way that if you go woke, you will go broke.” (The center ran a $1 million deficit on a $268 million budget last year.)

Ideas floated to take over Canada, Gaza, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. “Canada would be much better off being our 51st state. We’re going to have Gaza. We don’t have to buy. There’s nothing to buy.” It’s only the very beginning of the Trump administration. But already, Democrats are struggling to mount an effective opposition to what they see as an attempt to upend American democracy. Senator Ruben Gallego has some advice. “What I’m seeing is a lot of people that are just kind of frozen.” The junior Democratic senator from the swing state of Arizona won a tight race this past November. It was one of the few bright spots for Democrats. His personal story of growing up poor, studying at Harvard, joining the Marines, and then fighting in Iraq helped him connect with demographic groups Democrats need to win back. The question is, can his recipe for success be replicated by a party that is looking for a way in from the cold? “We’re more stuck on appeasing a group of people that don’t actually represent any constituencies than actually taking care of people’s real lives.” “I’m Lulu Garcia-Navarro, and here’s my interview with Senator Ruben Gallego.” [THEME MUSIC] [SPEAKING SPANISH] “Oh, man. Now I’m intimidated. Your Spanish is way better than mine.” “Ah!” - [SPEAKING SPANISH] - [SPEAKING SPANISH] “Oh, wow.” “Senator, thank you so much for being with us today. I almost don’t know where to start because so much has happened in such a short amount of time. And it occurs to me you’re a first-term senator, but you were in the House for about 10 years before that.” “That’s right, yep.” “And you were in Congress during the first Trump administration.” “I was, actually, yeah.” “Yeah. Sp I guess I’m wondering, does this time feel different?” “It does. And two things. No. 1, a lot what you see Trump is doing now is what he tried the first time around. But this time around, we don’t have Republican allies. What that means is that we’re basically fighting on our own. For me, this is more reminiscent of when I was in the state house, when the Republicans had full control of the House, the Senate, and — ” “In Arizona.” “Yeah, and the governorship in Arizona. And there was just no way of stopping them except for trying to find the best way to bring to light what problems they were causing, what they were violating, what they were going to overall just turning the state into. And right now, I think that’s where you’re seeing a lot of the Democratic establishment party elected officials trying to figure out what to do.” “Do you see a shift in how seriously the party is taking this moment?” “I do think that the party, and at least talking to my colleagues, are starting to see that this is an existential threat, if they keep going down this road. If we can’t rely on the judiciary to be part of those checks and balances, then what is left? I think what I’m seeing is a lot of people that are just kind of frozen. And it’s something that happens a lot when situations become out of the norm. And so people want to make something that’s not normal normal, because if you actually have to accept the reality, it gets very, very scary. For me, I think we are sliding into that.” “Mm. And I guess the big question for Democrats is what it means to be an effective opposition party. And I think there are two issues here, right? One is what Democrats should actually do to counter Trump’s actions, and the other is how you should communicate what you’re doing. There is talk of using government spending, which has to be negotiated by March 14, as leverage. Obviously, the risk is that if there is a shutdown, the Democrats will be blamed for that at a moment when, indeed, the party is trying to reach voters, rebuild itself, communicate that it is a party worth voting for. Is the risk too high?” “I mean, the risk is always there. We can’t be afraid of failing. That’s No. 1. I think that’s the biggest mistake I’ve seen Democrats do is say, we’re always afraid. We’re always afraid of failing, so we don’t take risks. It’s OK for us to recognize that that is a potential fallback. But we could also be working to mitigate that somehow. And what does that look like? Making sure that we meet the moment where the American public is. And maybe that moment will happen soon. I’m not sure it’s March 15, but making sure that we’re talking to them, we’re showing them that we’re the ones that are trying to be the people that are, No. 1, protecting the Constitution, number two, fighting for you. Because all this BS that’s happening right now, prices are still high. The cost of eggs are still high. People can’t buy homes. And I think that’s the one thing that we still need to figure out how to pivot back, because that’s where the Republicans are the weakest at. They own this economy now, and they’re not doing stuff for everyday Americans right now.” “I could see you in your brain changing the word.” “My wife warned me before I left for work today not to swear. But the problem is, I think we have to separate what we’re hearing from the D.C. crowd from what we’re hearing kind of in the streets, from what we’re hearing about everyday common Americans. Because I go back to Arizona, they’re actually not talking about U.S.A.I.D., and they’re not talking about the courts. They’re still talking about egg prices. They’re still talking about the cost of everything. So one of the things we have to be very mindful of is that we may engage in a fight, but the rest of the American public may not be with us because they don’t understand this fight. And we need to make sure that we’re matching our politics to what actually is happening in the world. Because sometimes, when we have that disconnect, we miss, and then we miss really, really badly. And unfortunately, now we know we can’t miss because when we do, it has political fallout. Like, the stuff that’s happening right now is because we entirely missed where the American public was during the 2024 election.” “I want to take a step back because, as we’ve mentioned, Democrats are trying to redefine their party. And your victory in a state that Trump won has been framed as possibly offering a model for what kind of message actually works. You outperformed Harris in your state, meaning that you won over some Trump voters. Why do you think that happened?” “Because I do understand that not all Trump voters are actual straight-down-the-line Trump voters. I think there’s a lot of people that voted for Trump because they were frustrated with what was happening in this country, and we weren’t afraid to reach out to them. And we went to some of the hardest places in the state from some Republican counties. We sat down with Trump supporters. We weren’t afraid to talk to them, and we did it repeatedly.” “Do you think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters?” “I think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters. I think Democrats are afraid to talk to people that are going to criticize them. And I think that’s — in a state like Arizona, there’s 300,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats in Arizona. I had no choice. It was either do it, or you’re not going to make it. And so we went out there. We sat down. We met with them. And our messaging also was very, very clear to the everyday Arizonan, which I think is very different than the national campaign was.” “Why do you think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters?” “I don’t know. I feel like if a lot of them had been doing it, I think they probably would have done a little better. Like, why aren’t they going into the reddest areas of the country and talking to them? Donald Trump goes to Harlem. Do we go to the equivalent of Harlem for the red voter? No, we don’t.” “I want to talk through some demographic groups that Democrats really need to win back if they want to be competitive.” “Everybody? Yeah.” “I mean, men, for example.” “Yeah.” “You’ve been described to me as a bro.” - [LAUGHS]: “And not in a bad way, just as a kind of persona.” “Yeah.” “You won Latino men by 30 points in an election that saw Trump dominate that group.” “Yeah.” “I know men are a very broad group. But what do you think Democrats have misunderstood about men?” “We could be working to make the status of men better without, at the same time, diminishing the status of women. And a lot of times, we forget that we still need men to vote for us. That’s how we still win elections. But we don’t really talk about making the life of men better, working to make sure that they have wages so they could support their families. I also think some of this is just purely psychological, that a lot of times we just can’t put our finger on. But during my campaign, I noticed when I was talking to men, especially Latino men, about the feeling of pride bringing money home, being able to support your family, the feeling of bringing security, for them, they wanted to hear that someone understood that need. And a lot of times, we are so afraid, I think, of communicating that to men because we think somehow we’re going to also diminish the status of women. And I think we need to understand that that’s going to end up being a problem. The fact that we don’t talk this way at all to them makes them just think that we don’t really care about them, when in fact, even when we’re not talking about them and we’re not campaigning about them, the Democrats on par are actually very good about the status of working-class men. I think Democrats need to figure out how we communicate that to guys and be like, Hey, we’re going to make sure that you’re going to have a good-paying job so you can start a family. It was a joke, but I said it a lot when I was talking to Latino men, like, I’m going to make sure you get out of your mom’s house, right? You get your [SPANISH]. For English speakers, that means your truck. Every Latino man wants a big-ass truck, which is nothing wrong with that, either. And you’re going to go start your own job, and you’re going to become rich, right? These are the conversations that we should be having. And for some reason, we have become — we’re afraid of saying these types of things. We’re afraid of saying like, hey, let’s help you get a job so you become rich. We use terms like bring more economic stability to you, right? And these guys don’t want that. They don’t want economic stability. They want to really live the American dream. And so honestly, the reason I think I did better than most male Democratic politicians is because I communicated that to them in the very simplest of terms, and that’s it.” “I mean, I think what you’re describing is more traditional values, right?” “But people vote on values.” “Right. But are you saying that Democrats should recognize that people want more traditional gender roles, be less afraid of that?” “No, I think Democrats should recognize that people want them to understand that they matter. Right? But it doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re going to say the single mom is less important than the father. That’s not what we’re saying. But just saying yes, you matter, too. You matter in this world, right? You are deserving of a government that’s going to respond to somebody. Because supposedly, as Democrats we are supposed to be fighting for everybody, but the way that these men think about things and look at the world, they don’t see that. And as someone that grew up on job sites, construction sites, I worked in factories, if you go to these construction sites, these factories, the type of communication you’re hearing that these guys talking to each other, it’s very much not at all what we think. And — ” “Tell me what that means.” “Well, working-class men, especially Latino men, don’t really listen to political commercials. They don’t watch TV news. They largely will talk amongst themselves. And sometimes other working class men will come in with their opinion, and that’s the only thing they’re hearing. That’s it. And — ” “Well, there’s the WhatsApp groups. Come on.” “Yeah. But those WhatsApp groups aren’t good for Democrats, either.” “No.” “And so we have to break that. I mean, so one of the things I did is I would host morning tacos at work sites, right, during the election. So I would go set up, knowing when the 5:30 a.m. shift was coming off, and I’d set up tacos. And I’d hand out tacos to the dudes, and I’d talk to them about life. And we have to understand where they are. We have to understand what they’re hearing. Because what they’re hearing is that the Democrats aren’t really for them, and they’re hearing it from the one dude that heard it from WhatsApp, or the one dude that’s listening to talk radio. And there’s no one saying like, Well, actually, I heard from another guy that Democrats are actually doing this. Doesn’t happen. It just doesn’t happen because there’s no way for us to give them that information, because we’re not going to where they are.” “You know, after the midterms in 2022, when Democrats did better than expected, many Democrats, and you included, seemed to take away that there wasn’t this rightward shift among the Latino community. In fact, you said, and I’m quoting here, ‘Reporters were talking about realignment. There’s no effing — ’” “Realignment.” “Realignment.” “You said ‘effing.’” “I said ‘effing.’ That’s not the word you used. Why did you get it wrong?” “Because I was right then. In 2022, this is when I was the head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. We had polling that showed that there was no slippage happening because men, especially Latino men, were frustrated, but they felt that things were getting better. And there was also an understanding, especially from women, that Democrats were better for them. With the recession — with the personal recession, not necessarily the government recession — continuing on more and more and more, and with housing pricing not going down, that’s when things just started sliding. Economically, we weren’t meeting the demands of where they were. I think they were willing to be hopeful because Biden had just gotten in. A lot of the stimulus money still had not worn out. But starting around, like, early 2023, a lot of the stimulus money went away because we negotiated with the Republicans for it to go away. Interest rates stayed high. And if, for a lot of families, Latino families, owning a home, buying a home is part of the American dream, and now it has gone even further and further away. So the economics just did not improve. And as soon as some of us heard it, we started putting up the warning signs. But it just wasn’t heard.” “Hmm.” “Lastly, what also is the difference is that the way that Trump communicates is actually more apt to get younger Latino men voters. Because where they gather their information, where they listen to politics, is where Trump is more often versus where we are. He’s on podcasts all the time. He’s at UFC fights, right? He’s at all these things where they actually see him being a real, quote-unquote, man. And going into the election, 2023, I also warned Democrats about that — we needed to get out there. I had a lot of recommendations that weren’t listened to. Like I wanted President Biden to go to the Copa América game and sit next to some Latino celebrity. I love boxing. I’m like, let’s go to some boxing matches, right? Let’s take some Democrats to boxing matches and meet where a lot of Latinos are. And the fact is, when you go into a big election in 2024, and you’re going to have a lot of young men coming to vote for the first time that didn’t vote in 2022, and all they’re learning about politics is through podcasts, through UFC fights, we’re going to start losing that vote if we don’t — and we did. And we need to figure out how to get into that world.” “I was actually shocked to learn that President Trump was the first sitting president to go to a Super Bowl game.” “Yeah, and he’ll go to UFC fights. He’s going to go to soccer games. He’s going to do everything, right? And why are we not doing it? I’ll tell you why, because I have heard this before — and I’m not going to tell you which politician was worried about this, but their staff told me, I don’t want my guy getting booed. It’s like, well. So you don’t expose yourself to anybody, but then you also don’t expose yourself to anybody. And again, this isn’t just the president. This is everybody really running last year. This is the thing that we have to understand as Democrats. If we’re not willing to be booed, take chances, the people that really get hurt are the people that we’re supposedly in office for, right, the people that are barely making it now. And they’re going to be hurt because we didn’t take chances.” “Hmm. I want to turn to the subject of class. I interviewed JD Vance before the election, and it struck me that even though your politics are obviously very different than his, your backgrounds do share some similar traits — working class, raised by single mothers, military service in Iraq, went to the Ivy League. And that story of class transition does seem to resonate with voters.” “I think most voters want to believe and do believe in the American dream. And I think when they see examples of that being true, that gives them some hope, right? And I’m sure JD heard this, but I certainly heard about this on the campaign trail from single moms who brought their kids up to me and like, I want them to meet you because I want them to be like you. He’s growing up with the same situation that I am, or that you were, right? And sometimes people miss it. I remember during my campaigns, some of my advisers said, You can’t talk about Harvard. I’m like, Why not? Well, you want working-class people to like you, if you tell them you went to Harvard, you’re going to remind them that you’re not part of that. I’m like, No, you’re not getting it, right? Working-class people appreciate kids going to college. They appreciate especially kids that came from poverty going to college, because that’s part of the story, part of the American dream. And I think whether it comes from left or right, the example really matters, especially when things are rough. Like, you need that kind of hope to hang on to because that’s what helps you get through those days, especially those hard days, is knowing that things will get better. And this is psychologically what people miss about this campaign is when people started feeling like it’s not going to get better. That should have been a big tell that things were going to go south.” “Something I really struggle to reconcile is on the one hand, you have voters saying, as you have shown, that the economy and inflation are their top issues, and they feel the pain of price increases, which is completely understandable. On the other hand, under Trump, we now have the richest Cabinet in modern history. The world’s richest person is gutting the federal government. Yet polls show the president starting his second term with higher approval ratings than when he began his first term. And it sends this confusing message about what the electorate actually wants.” “I don’t think so.” “You have class as a central part of your story, so why don’t you think it’s a confusing message?” “Because people that are working class, poor, don’t necessarily look at the ultrarich as their competitors. They want to be rich someday. And so they don’t necessarily fault the quote-unquote rich for them being rich. Where they do fault them is when it starts affecting them. So they’re going to give Elon and his little weirdos the benefit of doubt. And they’re going to give Donald Trump the benefit of doubt until it proves that it’s actually affecting them personally, right? And that’s when you’ll see them start pushing back. Like, historically speaking, the thing that finally started moving Donald Trump’s numbers away before the 2018 elections was when he gave a massive tax cut to the rich. So I think that’s what’s going to end up happening. I think this administration is going to give a massive tax cut to the rich, and they’re going to do it by cutting Medicaid and other programs for the poor. And that’s when you’re going to see people saying, No, no, no, that’s not what I want.” “So the Democratic message among some Democrats of sort of ‘eat the rich,’ right — ” “Right. No, it’s not going to work.” “That’s not — ” “No.” “ — the right message.” “These people want to be rich. They want to be rich. The base Democratic voter wants to be rich. And there’s nothing wrong with that. And so our job is to expose when there are abuses by, quote-unquote, the rich, the wealthy, the powerful. Then that’s how we get those people that want to aspire to that to vote for Democrats.” “So Elon Musk, Donald Trump, are these the people who have actually figured out how to connect with the working class?” “Yes. Yeah. We just had an election that proved that. I mean — ” “Why?” “Well, I think because they both are two things that I think a lot of Democratic politicians are. No. 1, they actually understand, quote-unquote, the consumer. Right? And because they are engaged in, every day, one way or the other, trying to talk to the consumer. And in this case, it’s the voter, right?” “That’s so interesting. They’re salesmen, essentially.” “Yeah, exactly.” “And they understand who the client is.” “Mm-hmm. The client’s the voter. And they don’t care. By the way, that’s the other thing that’s — they don’t care how they get the sale done. Right? This is why you saw during the campaign, Trump said, You know what? No tax on tips. We’re not going to tax your security, all this kind of stuff. And on the other side, people were like, Well, that’s really going to do something and do an imbalance to the budget deficit. What did Donald Trump care? He just wanted to win, right? What does Elon Musk want to do? He just wants to win, right? He knows where the voter is, and he’ll get there however he can get there. But they’re closer to the ground, to where the base voter is, than to some of us Democrats.” “I want to ask you specifically about immigration, which was one of the central issues of the election, as we mentioned, and one that really hurt Democrats. I’m curious how your own story affects your view of the immigration debate. Your parents emigrated from Colombia and Mexico. What was your family’s experience with the immigration system?” “Well, so most of my experience with the immigration system was already kind of done. My mom was a naturalized citizen when I was born. My father was a legal green-card holder then. I don’t know what his status is now. But my experience was, for example, crossing the border fairly easily, back and forth. Going to work in Mexico, and then coming back when I used to work on the farm. And then whenever things were hard, we’d call up a cousin and say, Hey, we need someone else to come work, right? And they would come up. And so clearly, this is the 1980s. Borders were very fluid. People were coming, getting visas, working, going back. But then it’s also my experience kind of talking to — I have a very extended family on both sides — about their frustration, like, why I need to come to the United States, for example, talking to family in Mexico that had been waiting for their green card or had been waiting for their work visas and were waiting forever. Or even recently, the last six years with the refugee crisis at the border, hearing from Latinos, immigrant Latinos, saying like, Wait a minute, why is that person crossing the border and getting a work permit, and my cousin still doesn’t have a work permit? So I think kind of being closer to where your everyday Latino is on immigration is really what helped kind of set my policy mind-set, because what you were hearing was entirely different from what you were hearing from groups and other opinion leaders about where Latinos were on the border and immigration. There’s nuance within our communities, within the immigrant community, right? They can tell the difference, or they tell the difference, between recent immigrants that came in legally, immigrants that came in 10 years ago illegally, and refugees and asylum seekers right now. And a lot of them will say, That person that came in legally, yes. That person that came in 10 years ago, they shouldn’t have come in illegally, but they’re part of the community now. Let’s give them an opportunity to be U.S. citizens or come out of the shadows. That person that just crossed the border claiming asylum, and now they get a work permit? That’s BS, right? That’s not right. If you’re in that community, that makes sense to you. But if you’re kind of out and looking in, which a lot of Democrats do, that doesn’t make sense. So you just draw a general idea that they all think the same, and they just don’t.” “As senator, your first vote was for the Laken Riley Act. You were one of two Democratic co-sponsors of the bill, the other one being John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. Many in the immigrant advocacy community were, shall we say, unhappy with that position. They have criticized the law. They say it raises due process concerns for immigrants. Another big concern is that it will give states more control over immigration policy, essentially gutting federal authority over that. What was your thinking behind voting for the Laken Riley Act?” “Well, my thinking behind voting for it the second time, because I voted for it also in the House of Representatives, is that this is, again, a response of talking to voters. And they wanted more immigration control and reform. And look, what happened to Laken Riley was horrible. And look, these immigration groups, again, have some very valid points in some areas. But where they’re attacking or where they’re moving is not necessarily in line, again, where the majority of voters or even the immigrant community are. So I heard from them a lot. And the one thing I heard from them is like, this is not what Latinos want. They don’t want this bill. I’m like, That’s actually not true. I go home, and there was a lot of support for bills like this. And certainly, I think that there is a mismatch right now. The immigration groups have moved to a point where they somehow started representing that they represent the voice of Latinos, and they don’t. They’re not even close. And so one of the things I’ve been very clear in also telling my senator is like, listen to the immigration groups because they have good legal advice. Do not listen to the immigration groups if they tell you that this is a representation of where Latinos are, because they are totally off. And I’m responding to what I saw and heard out in Arizona. And that’s why I supported last year and this year.” “This bill, though, does seem to want to change the nature of how immigration is done in this country. And writ large, the architect of this administration’s immigration policies is Stephen Miller, who in the past has promoted hard-line views by citing the work of white nationalist websites, and that’s according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. There does seem to be a strain in this administration that does want to change the makeup of this country.” “Without a doubt, yup.” “Do you worry that voters’ legitimate concerns about our immigration system are being weaponized for ideological ends?” “Well, absolutely. But this isn’t new. I mean, immigration and border have been weaponized in politics for forever, before Donald Trump. I mean, when I was involved in the Arizona State House, it was being weaponized. So none of us should be surprised by it.” “So then was it hard for you to cast that vote, knowing that context? Because — ” “No, because this has been happening for the last 20 years. The context that I worry about is, like, how do we get the trust of people back to the point where we can actually bring the immigration conversation to a more normal state of frame? Let me give you kind of a bigger picture of this. When the Democrats basically dropped the ball on the chaos on the border for many years, we essentially lost the debate on immigration reform for years because the everyday voter doesn’t trust us on the border and on immigration reform. Because for years, they saw that chaos on the border, and we did nothing. The Biden administration finally moved, but by then, it had been so long and the damage had been done. And, by the way, for us that care about immigration reform — and we truly do, and I want to see immigration reform happen. I want to see undocumented families come out of the shadows. I want Dreamers to become citizens, everything else like that — we’ve been set back for years because we hesitated on asylum seekers when we knew in our guts that what was happening there was an abuse of the system, was unpopular with Democrats. But somehow, we decided that we were going to essentially just give the issue to the Republicans, when we could have had a very sane position on this.” “Do you blame President Biden for that?” “I blame President Biden, but I also blame a lot of the people that were advising President Biden, a lot of these groups that were advising President Biden. You’re only as good as the advice that’s given to you, but these immigration groups that I think are looking out for people ended up making the situation a lot worse now.” “Just to understand where you stand on specific issues, for example, should local law enforcement be helping ICE carry out deportations?” “No, because if you talk to local law enforcement, and especially in Arizona, talking to sheriffs and talking to the police, they don’t have the bandwidth. They don’t want to do this. They want to keep the community relationships. And police are there to actually enforce local laws. If it’s someone that is a drug runner or criminal and they need police backup, sure. Why wouldn’t you, if there’s a warrant or anything else like that? But no, you shouldn’t have police doing local immigration laws, especially because can’t even afford it.” “Should migrants be sent to Guantanamo or to prisons in El Salvador?” “Not migrants that have their due process, and especially not ones that aren’t dangerous. But certainly ones that are severely dangerous, like people that have committed crimes, but we can’t legally hold them here, I think there’s something to be said about that.” “I’m surprised.” “For gang members, criminals? I mean, why would we want to keep gang members and criminals that don’t even have a legal right to be here, and Venezuela won’t take them back?” “I think there is a concern that people that get put into these systems, it’s sort of like a black hole. It’s a legal limbo.” “We’ve been having legal limbo for the immigrant community forever. I mean, Guantanamo has been used for refugees and asylum seekers prior to this.” “But not ones that have been in the United States. They’re people who have been caught at sea — ” “Caught at sea. OK, I see what you’re saying.” “Yeah.” “Look, at the same time, we’re dealing in very different situations. If there is a hard-core criminal that has gone through our judicial system, but we can’t actually deport, what are we going to do? I’m not saying, again, we do this for everybody. But there has to be some logical security that we should be thinking about because they’re going to end up being criminals again, especially in these very, very vulnerable communities.” “How have you seen the deportation working in the last three weeks since Trump has taken over?” “So talking to people in Arizona, talking to ICE agents also, it’s caused a lot of fear. Some of the ICE agents are very frustrated, also, because they feel that they’re put on to make an artificial quota, that they first were sent to go after hard-core criminals, and now they’re kind of being pushed to just grab anybody. So, for example, in Arizona, they have a quota of 75 people per day. The frustration, I think, is also in the fact that there isn’t really any coordination of need. So for example, they’re bringing investigators off A.T.F., D.E.A., and HSI who are actually going after real criminals, both U.S. citizen and non-U.S. citizens, and they’re just being thrown in here to essentially do a show of force. And so it’s a frustration on both sides, too. They have families that are living in fear because there’s no real communications happening from ICE. And there’s the actual agents themselves feel like this is not a good use of my time, nor taxpayer dollar, for security. And so I think if Donald Trump actually wanted to get rid of these hard-core criminals, there is an actual way to do this, where you would have a lot of these undocumented families that have been here forever, the ones that have kids that are here, that will likely help you. But when you kind of are trying to cast a wide net, you’re going to have everyone hide, and you’re going to end up probably making a lot of these criminals that are here illegally be able to get away with it.” “Do you take Donald Trump and his administration at face value that what they’re interested in doing is deporting criminals, as opposed to deporting immigrants?” “No, I don’t take it at face value. This is why where can we have our points of leverage to have them focus on that is going to be the harder question. Because right now, with this election, we basically hand them the keys to everything. So what can we do to actually make them focus on these hard-core criminals is going to be the next, really, the big fight.” “As you’ve discussed, there are concerns about Democrats being too deferential to the more liberal parts of the party. Yes, on immigration, but also gender, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, D.E.I., whatever it is. And these are all things that the right has been hammering Democrats on for a while, and it seems to be working. So how do Democrats stand for what they believe in without being seen by voters as being outside of the mainstream?” “Well, I think the first problem is it’s easier for us to be hit as being extremist if we’re not also known for something. If we’re not fighting to make someone’s life better, to minimize or bring down the cost of living, raise wages — if we’re not actively fighting for that, it’s going to be easier for people to take the most extreme positions and say, Well, that’s actually what the Democrats are, right? I think most Americans are actually very much pro-L.G.B.T. I think they are pro-women’s rights. I think they’re more aligned with Democrats than what the Republicans are. But when we aren’t identified as at the core of doing something for the kind of grander America, they’re just going to be able to like, See? They’re just so focused on these small little niche groups instead of you. And that resonated. But again, we need to recognize that when Democrats fail, when we fail in making people’s lives better — and I know, again, someone’s going to go — I don’t know if you have blogs attached to this podcast. You’re going to say, Well, the G.D.P. under Biden was the highest and we had the lowest unemployment ever. Ruben Gallego is wrong. Yes, that was all true. But people were not feeling it. People were just not feeling it. And again, if we want to lie to ourselves and say, Well, things were really good, the economy was really good, when people were telling us it was not, we’re going to continue having this problem. And it’s going to be easier for people to take opportunities to take away some of these basic rights if we allow the middle of America to continue to suffer economically.” “Senator Ruben Gallego, thank you very much.” “Thank you.” [THEME MUSIC]",New York Times

And, on the weekends, he has still found time for sports.Last weekend, Mr. Trump played some golf with Tiger Woods and became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. This Sunday, according to some news reports, he may be at the Daytona 500. Mr. Trump attended the race in 2020 with the first lady, Melania Trump, and served as its grand marshal, shortly before the nation shut down for the coronavirus pandemic.Mr. Trump is spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence in Palm Beach, Fla., about 200 miles south of the Daytona International Speedway. The White House has not confirmed his attendance, but the Federal Aviation Administration issued “temporary flight restrictions for V.I.P. movement” for the area for part of Sunday. This year’s race already has a grand marshal, though: Anthony Mackie, the star of the film “Captain America: Brave New World.”Mr. Trump’s appearance at Daytona on Sunday would cap a whirlwind week of mixing sports with politics. Last Sunday morning, the president played a few holes with the Hall of Fame golfer Tiger Woods in Florida, as they’ve been working on a merger between the PGA Tour and the Saudi-backed LIV Golf circuit.

But with President Trump back in office, America is giving the impression that it could be switching sides.Even as American and Russian negotiators sat down together on Tuesday for the first time since Moscow’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago, Mr. Trump has signaled that he is willing to abandon America’s allies to make common cause with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.As far as Mr. Trump is concerned, Russia is not responsible for the war that has devastated its neighbor. Instead, he suggests that Ukraine is to blame for Russia’s invasion of it. To listen to Mr. Trump talk with reporters on Tuesday about the conflict was to hear a version of reality that would be unrecognizable on the ground in Ukraine and certainly would never have been heard from any other American president of either party.In Mr. Trump’s telling, Ukrainian leaders were at fault for the war for not agreeing to surrender territory and therefore, he suggested, they do not deserve a seat at the table for the peace talks that he has just initiated with Mr. Putin. “You should have never started it,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Ukrainian leaders who, in fact, did not start it. “You could have made a deal.”",New York Times

Do You Have a Plan for the Nickel?","The benefits of the status quo are clear: The Mint is expected to remain profitable in the near future. Taking action on the penny or any other coin, as we’ll see, comes with trade-offs.Option 2: Stop minting the pennyIf the Mint did stop minting pennies, it would save about $85 million a year. Unfortunately, it would then have bigger and more expensive problem: the nickel.“If you get rid of the penny, it will increase the amount of nickels,” Mr. Jeppson said. “And you lose more on a nickel than you do on a penny.”Last year the government lost 8.8 cents on each nickel it minted (compared with 2.7 cents per penny). Because many times more pennies are minted than nickels, losses were higher for the penny, but this isn’t always the case. In 2023, for example, the Mint made more nickels than normal and lost $93 million making them compared with $86 million in losses making the penny. The size of the orders for each coin comes from the Federal Reserve, and the orders fluctuate each year, depending on demand.It’s unclear exactly how high demand would be for nickels in a penny-less world, but it’s likely that it would be higher than today. And, given their expense, it’s possible those costs could eventually swallow up any savings gained by eliminating the penny.There are other effects to consider, too. Many states have a sales tax that specifies taxes collected must be rounded to the nearest cent, so they would probably have to modify their laws to accommodate cash purchases. Stores would need new rounding policies for purchases made in cash.But it is possible to eliminate the penny. Canada did it in 2012, and the Defense Department stopped using pennies on its bases in the 1980s when it decided it wasn’t worth the cost of shipping them.",New York Times

It Was Actually $8 Million.,"The Department of Government Efficiency, the federal cost-cutting initiative championed by Elon Musk, published on Monday a list of government contracts it has canceled, together amounting to about $16 billion in savings itemized on a new “wall of receipts” on its website.Almost half of those line-item savings could be attributed to a single $8 billion contract for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

38,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/16/us/new-gun-owners.html,2025-02-16 00:00:00+00:00,The Tipping Point,"Ms. Kolanowski, a 28-year-old epidemiologist in Iowa, had once believed that no one needed to own a gun.But when she came out as transgender in 2021, and began transitioning from male to female, she had a realization: “I’m a minority now, in a world that is pretty hostile to that minority.”In 2022, Ms. Kolanowski bought a Glock 43X handgun and started learning how to use it.In hours of conversations with New York Times journalists, these five Americans shared deeply individual reasons for their leaps into gun ownership. But there were also common threads: new fears about political violence and hate crimes, and a diminished trust in law enforcement.Most said they had been surprised by how much they enjoyed learning to shoot, and improving their skills.Meet the Newest Gun OwnersWhile a majority of gun owners are white, conservative, male and from rural areas, some surveys have detected an uptick in those who are not. One by Harvard researchers found that among people who purchased their first gun between 2019 and 2021, 20 percent were Black, 20 percent were Hispanic and approximately half were women.Behind the data, the stories of individual Americans who have bought guns in the past five years offer clues about how the country is changing — as the definitions of liberal and conservative evolve, and angst about our divisions runs high.The Forces at PlayA World on Fire, a Gun at the ReadyAbove all, new gun owners said, they are motivated by a need to feel prepared for anything, in a world that feels to them less stable.The last two decades have seen rapid growth in the share of people who cite self-protection as their primary reason for buying firearms; they now comprise more than 70 percent of all gun buyers.For some, intensified concerns about personal safety have dispelled a lifelong aversion to guns.Anna Kolanowski“It’s been a perspective shift for me.”The fear that motivated Ms. Kolanowski, who describes her politics as leftist, also drives gun owners on the other side of the political spectrum.Mr. Alvarado, 30, a service technician and political conservative in southern Maine, said he started buying guns in part because he perceived a threat to stable society, and to his own family, from shifting social norms and practices.“Morality is all over the place,” he said, “and because my viewpoints are more traditional it puts a target on my back.”Mr. Alvarado, who is Black and Latino, said he became a staunch conservative during the pandemic, after years as a liberal voter. As he watched mask and vaccine mandates multiply in 2020, and neighbors turning against those who did not comply, Mr. Alvarado lost faith in the government and reconsidered his own politics.He started attending a conservative Baptist church with his wife and reading the Bible. (His pastor faced public condemnation for defying pandemic health policies.) Mr. Alvarado, who first purchased a gun in 2020, soon began to see arming himself as a way to defend his beliefs and his family’s desire to live as they wished.John Alvarado“When I first made my purchase, I was a lot more left leaning.”He now owns six guns and serves on the security team at his church, patrolling the building during worship services.Dr. Green, Mr. Tsien and Ms. Kolanowski, all of whom vote or lean Democrat, said that Mr. Trump’s first term had factored into their decisions to buy their first guns; they saw those years as destabilizing the country and normalizing intolerance.The attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters in January 2021 was the final straw for Dr. Green, 70, a retired Navy dentist and physiologist who lives in California. He bought his first firearm, a Smith and Wesson 9-millimeter handgun, the next month.His journey toward gun ownership had begun a few years earlier, in 2017, when he learned that white nationalists at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., had raised swastikas and chanted, “Jews will not replace us.”The specter of the Holocaust loomed over his decision to arm himself.Dr. Ken Green“We were virtually the only Jewish family in our neighborhood.”“If Trump hadn’t been elected” in 2016, Dr. Green said, “I probably would not be a gun owner today.”Mr. Tsien, a father of three young children who recently moved from New Jersey to Massachusetts, bought his first gun, a Ruger .22-caliber pistol, after hate speech and violence against Asians spiked in the early weeks of the pandemic.Like Dr. Green, Mr. Tsien, 47, was haunted by history. His Chinese parents and grandparents experienced life-altering trauma and loss during decades of war in their homeland, and their stories permeated his upbringing.Long before Mr. Trump rose to power, Mr. Tsien said he had been taught that a safe and stable society could fall apart at any time — and that owning guns might prove necessary.John Tsien“What makes it necessary to own a firearm?”Trends in gun sales have long been shaped by social and political upheaval, often soaring after mass shootings and national elections.Even some who are driven to buy firearms simply to protect themselves against crime have felt more of a need for self-protection in the current political climate.For Ms. Alston, a 30-year-old Black woman who works in banking in Little Rock, Ark., the desire to own a gun arose after her separation. And her race made her feel particularly vulnerable, she said: “Black women are the least protected and the least respected.”Victoria Alston“There’s so many women getting attacked.”In 2022, she was rattled by an overnight theft on her rural property. Ms. Alston bought a Canik 9-millimeter pistol and signed up for training at a gun range managed by another Black woman.Her intent, like that of other women at the range, was not to “look cute,” she said. “We don’t want to always have to look for a man to protect us.”Navigating Risk and CriticismOn a steaming hot Sunday last summer in southern Maine, Mr. Alvarado circulated a collection plate at Calvary Baptist Church.He wore a suit and a gold tie clip that read, “I love Jesus and guns.” A PSA Dagger handgun was holstered at his waist. A small microphone tucked into his ear linked him to the rest of the church security team.After years of seeking “a reason,” Mr. Alvarado said, he had found his here.John Alvarado“We're here for a reason. I'm here for a reason.”Some have found the evolution to be fraught. Several said they had to work through concerns about mental health and suicide when considering whether to have guns in the house. Suicides have long accounted for a majority of gun deaths in the United States; experts say one reason is the number of firearms. The country is the only one in the world where civilian guns outnumber people.In January, Americans bought an estimated 1.29 million guns — a decrease from the spike seen during the pandemic, but still higher than the average monthly sales before the pandemic.Before buying a gun, Mr. Tsien had to negotiate the terms with his wife, Sarah McLean. She felt deeply uneasy about him storing his guns at home, even unloaded, in a locked safe.“I don’t fully understand it, and I’m a little uncomfortable with it,” Ms. McLean said. “But it’s important to him, and I trust him.”When one of their children needed mental health treatment, Mr. Tsien took extra precautions.“Everything went in the attic,” he said of that time. “If there is any question, the guns go away.”John Tsien“I immediately put everything in the attic.”In Little Rock, Ms. Alston’s mother knows she has a gun, and is supportive. But Ms. Alston is not sure whether her father, who talked her out of buying a gun when she was younger, is aware.“Would he see me differently?” she said. “I had to work through that.”For Ms. Kolanowski, the decision to take up shooting while transitioning has brought new anxieties. She worries that she may be unwelcome or harassed if people at the shooting range where she practices become aware that she is transgender.She minimizes her interactions with others there, she said, and presents herself in an androgynous way, to feel safe.With her parents — Polish immigrants, and longtime gun owners, who were not completely comfortable with her gender transition — Ms. Kolanowski’s new hobby has provided a bonding opportunity.“It’s kind of cute, like, ‘We have something in common!’” she said.Purpose and Pleasure in a New PursuitMs. Kolanowski and the other new owners said they had expected to feel more confident and self-reliant after buying guns. Less expected, they said, were the new friends they made, and the uplifting sense of having bridged a societal divide.Several described a profound enjoyment of a pastime they never dreamed would be so satisfying.Though he dislikes the macho energy that he sees pervading gun culture, Mr. Tsien says he has found shooting to be a deeply meditative, calming pursuit.He likens the hobby to others he has embraced in the past, like photography and scuba diving, where part of the appeal is mastering a complicated tool and understanding how it works.The Joy of ShootingFor Ms. Alston, the connection with other Black women at her shooting range felt energizing and empowering: “We’re finally becoming less afraid,” she said.Likewise, Dr. Green sees his gun ownership as a way of defending his Jewish identity.“One of the reasons the Holocaust happened is because people allowed it to happen,” he said. “Not on my watch.”Several said they looked for opportunities to talk about their decisions, even with those who were skeptical, in hopes of promoting dialogue and understanding.In Mr. Alvarado’s church in Maine last summer, he sat by a door in the back, keeping watch. His role on the security team is “where I fit in,” he said. “It feels purposeful, and it feels good to have a purpose.”",New York Times

The S.S.A. concluded that “almost none” of them were receiving payments from the agency — in fact, that was part of why the agency argued it wasn’t worth the expense to try to clean up information about people who largely died before the advent of electronic records.“Elon Musk did not discover this problem in the Numident,” said Kathleen Romig, the director of social security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and a former adviser at the S.S.A. “Even to call it a problem is exaggerating.

But one thing was clear: An epochal breach appears to be opening in the Western alliance.After three years of war that forged a new unity within NATO, the Trump administration has made clear it is planning to focus its attention elsewhere: in Asia, Latin America, the Arctic and anywhere President Trump believes the United States can obtain critical mineral rights.European officials who emerged from a meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said they now expect that tens of thousands of American troops will be pulled out of Europe — the only question is how many, and how fast.And they fear that in one-on-one negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Trump is on his way to agreeing to terms that could ultimately put Moscow in a position to own a fifth of Ukraine and to prepare to take the rest in a few years’ time.

But the agency’s Epidemic Intelligence Service — the “disease detectives” who track outbreaks around the world — has apparently been spared, perhaps because of an uproar among alumni after a majority of its members were told on Friday that they would be let go.President Trump’s plan to shrink the size of the federal work force dealt blows to thousands of civil servants in the past few days. But the cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services — coming on the heels of the coronavirus pandemic, the worst public health crisis in a century — have been especially jarring.

But it was unclear whether this was meant as compensation only for past American support to Kyiv’s war effort against Russian invaders, or if it would also come in exchange for future military and financial assistance.On Sunday, the U.S. national security adviser, Mike Waltz, indicated it was at least partly for past support. “The American people deserve to be recouped, deserve to have some kind of payback for the billions they have invested in this war,” he was quoted as saying. “I think that Zelensky would be very wise to enter into this agreement with the United States.”A Ukrainian official and an energy expert briefed on the proposal said that the Trump administration sought not only Ukraine’s minerals but additional natural resources, including oil and gas. The proposal, they said, would entitle the United States to half of Ukraine’s resource earnings — funds that are today mostly invested in the country’s military and defense production.",New York Times

Majorities of Jews disapproved of both parties’ approaches.The survey, conducted late last year, found Jews to be equally worried about antisemitism on the “extreme political right” and the “extreme political left.” But that was a notable shift from four years earlier, when Jews were much more likely to say the extreme right represented an antisemitic threat.“They don’t quite know where they belong, and I don’t think there’s an easy answer on either side,” said Deborah E. Lipstadt, who was the Biden administration’s special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, speaking in particular of “strongly committed, identifying Jews.” She added, “I don’t think personally I’ve ever seen such a time, in terms of, ‘Where do we stand?’ or, ‘where’s our political home?’”",New York Times

Year after year, in poll after poll, voters report that they do not think lawmakers on Capitol Hill care about the people they represent, nor do they think they do a good job of promoting laws and policies that serve the public interest.Members of both parties report that their elected officials do a bad job of listening to constituents and a worse job of keeping their financial interests separate from their work on Capitol Hill. As for working across the aisle, well, 80 percent of Democrats and Republicans said lawmakers were not good at it, according to a Pew Research survey from 2023.And Congress as an institution typically earns a lower approval rating than the lawmakers whom voters say they do not particularly trust.

Reyes of the Federal District Court in Washington marked a rare victory for the Trump administration in the barrage of lawsuits that has followed its attempts to slash the federal work force, freeze funding, dismantle agencies and install officials loyal to the president. But it is not necessarily permanent: Judge Reyes criticized the case more on procedural than substantive grounds and allowed it to proceed on a less urgent schedule.Still, in a roughly 10-minute hearing scheduled just hours before it was held via a conference call, she repeatedly berated the plaintiffs’ lawyers for the manner in which they brought the case. She also faulted what she considered to be their weak arguments for immediately reinstating the eight inspectors general, who performed oversight of the Departments of Defense, State, Education, Agriculture, Labor, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, as well as the Small Business Administration.At one point Judge Reyes, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., went as far as to threaten the plaintiffs with court sanctions if they did not immediately withdraw their emergency request so the case could proceed on a slower timeline.

Even such a huge sum is not nearly enough for all of their ideas, and so lawmakers must now decide which policy commitments are essential and which ones they can live without.For a sense of the Republican predicament, take a look at the 2017 tax cuts. Many of the measures in that law, including a larger standard deduction and more generous child tax credit, expire at the end of the year. The overriding goal of this year’s bill is to extend the expiring provisions, which provide their largest benefits to the rich, before they end.But accomplishing just that would cost roughly $4 trillion over the next 10 years. Then there’s a coveted business tax break for research and development — which, in an example of the zigzag of tax policy in Washington, Republicans wound down in 2017 and now want to revive. That would be another $150 billion. Allowing companies to once again deduct more of the interest on their debt is another $50 billion.",New York Times

The 1980s saw more transparent soft-power initiatives under the auspices of agencies like U.S.A.I.D. and government-funded organizations like the National Endowment for Democracy.Broadly supported by anti-communist Republicans and Democrats, these efforts were often met with skepticism on the left — and now, by Mr. Benz and Mr. Musk.They argue that U.S. government influence campaigns that once undermined the populist left in other countries were co-opted by liberals after the end of the Cold War, and are now being used against the populist right at home and abroad. As evidence, they point to grants to independent media and civil-society programs in Europe that have been critical of right-wing governments and support for misinformation-countering campaigns that have often targeted right-wing social media activity.“USAID is/was a radical-left political psy op,” Mr. Musk wrote in a Feb. 3 post on X citing Mr. Benz.To make this case, Mr. Benz has marshaled the decades-old work of left-wing journalists and scholars, such as the historian Alfred McCoy, whose research on the C.I.A. and U.S.A.I.D.’s role in heroin trafficking in Southeast Asia earned the ire of the C.I.A. in the early 1970s.Other arguments made by Trump allies echo those of President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Russian-funded media outlets. Following popular protests against Kremlin-friendly governments in Ukraine in 2004 and 2014, which were supported by the Bush and Obama administrations and American nongovernmental organizations, the Kremlin cast that support as a “coup” and a continuation of the United States’ Cold War machinations.

It has also arisen in litigation over an order by Mr. Trump’s Office of Management and Budget instructing agencies to halt as much as $3 trillion in domestic grants, loans and contractual spending.The White House later rescinded that order, and judges have blocked the government from complying with it. But groups that were awarded domestic grants have also reported that in practice, the systems that allow them to draw down on the funds have remained inaccessible.In response, one of the judges who intervened, John J. McConnell Jr. of U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, declared on Feb. 10 that the continued “pauses in funding violate the plain text” of his order. He said the administration “must immediately take every step necessary” to restore all the withheld funds.But almost immediately, the Trump administration came back with an argument that confounded that seemingly simple directive. It said that it wanted to freeze payments to New York City for a FEMA-run program that had helped defray the cost of putting up migrants in hotels and providing services to them. The stated rationale was based not on the O.M.B. memo but on concerns that the city was not complying with the conditions of the grant.In a slightly testy order, Judge McConnell agreed that the administration could, on its own, withhold that spending because the cited justification was “authority in the applicable statutory, regulatory or grant terms” separate from the O.M.B. directive. The administration proceeded not just to cut off the grant, but to claw back $80 million from the city’s bank accounts.",New York Times

But it went far beyond the scope of that decision by informing schools that considering race at all when making staffing decisions or offering services to subsets of students would be grounds for punishment.The letter was the latest step in the Trump administration’s push to recast programs intended to level the playing field for historically underserved populations as a form of racial discrimination. It also appeared to be an extension of the broadsides President Trump has delivered to purge diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives from the federal government, which critics have assailed as veiled racism.Craig Trainor, the Education Department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said related programs and scholarships, many of which have historically sought to help Black and Latino students attain college degrees or find community, had come at the expense of “white and Asian students, many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds.”",New York Times

As of Wednesday, there were about 175 held there, 127 of whom were considered “high-threat illegal aliens,” according to a Defense Department official, who was not authorized to discuss the operation and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Until now, the Migrant Operations Center has been the exclusive domain of the Department of Homeland Security, which has hired contractors to run it. As of last week, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of D.H.S. had 10 officers on temporary assignment for the entire migrant mission and plans to send 50 “contract security personnel,” homeland security representatives told Congress.To expand it to a capacity in the tens of thousands, the administration will need to add more personnel.

Many of his policy moves have been at least temporarily frozen by judges.Such moves include trying to unilaterally rewrite the definition of birthright citizenship — a right enshrined in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment — to exclude babies born to undocumented mothers, and mass firings of public servants, ignoring civil service protection laws. He has all but shuttered the agency responsible for foreign aid, dismissed prosecutors who investigated him, and fired Senate-confirmed watchdogs without giving proper notice to Congress or justification.Mr. Trump’s team has embraced an expansive version of the so-called unitary executive theory, a legal ideology that says that the Constitution should be understood as forbidding Congress from placing any limits on the president’s control of the executive branch, including by creating independent agencies or restricting the president’s ability to summarily fire any government official at will.",New York Times

That would end decades in which the United States has generally abided by the commitments it made internationally and would potentially usher in a new era of corporate uncertainty and global trade wars.Some of Mr. Trump’s threats could amount to negotiating tactics and fail to materialize. He sees tariffs as a powerful persuasive tool, which he is readily deploying to try to force other countries to make concessions on migration, drug enforcement and even their territory. But he and his base of supporters also view tariffs as a crucial policy in their own right, a way to reverse decades of factories leaving the United States and to create jobs and shrink trade deficits.While Mr. Trump has long held those views, he was reined in during his first term by opponents who saw the value in more open trade. Some of his own advisers, leading Republican politicians and many in the business community argued that aggressive tariffs would hurt the stock market and the global economy.This time around, the president is flanked by advisers who support his combative trade agenda. They include Peter Navarro, an ardent trade skeptic, who is one of Mr. Trump’s top trade advisers and is helping to craft his policies. Howard Lutnick, whom Mr. Trump has nominated as his commerce secretary, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have also publicly announced their support for tariffs.During Mr. Trump’s first term, it took him more than a year to impose any tariffs. The president stunned the world in April 2017 by initiating a national security investigation into tens of billions of dollars of steel and aluminum imports, including those from allies like Canada, Europe and Mexico. But that inquiry did not result in levies until nearly a year later.",New York Times

For workers to come fix the Wi-Fi, we were instructed to leave the key in a lockbox. (The lights were never fixed.) Two days later, we returned in the afternoon to find our apartment had been robbed, with a laptop, clothing and other items missing. It’s not clear how the thief accessed the building — he would have had to get through two gates with key codes — but we think we know how he got in the door. We found a key to the apartment under the doormat! We spent two days filing reports with the police, who were very thorough and ended up catching the thief. (He was sentenced to six months in prison.) But although Airbnb advertises its insurance coverage on its site, its agents had us running around in circles before finally advising us they would not compensate us. Our insurance eventually paid us about $4,000 for our lost goods, but we believe that should have been Airbnb’s responsibility, and that the company should credit us for our ruined stay and pay us back for the data.

In the language of flowers (used in Victorian England as a form of coded communication), tulips signified passion, according to the Smithsonian Gardens. The Society of American Florists further gives meaning to the flower based on its color. A pink tulip is for caring, while purple stands for royalty and red is a declaration of love. The flower’s expansive meanings help with its Valentine’s Day appeal. The holiday is no longer just for lovers, but a day to celebrate all kinds of love — friends, family and even pets.“Roses are about sex,” said Andrew Miller, the owner of Tulip Valley Farms in Washington State, but tulips have “the meaning that we decide to give it.”“I can give tulips to a buddy of mine that, you know, we go hunting together,” he said.Allan Visser, a third-generation tulip farmer in the Netherlands, checked off the numerous upsides to the flower: They come in a variety of colors and shapes; they’re more sustainable because they can be grown more quickly, with less heat for shorter periods of time so even greenhouses use less energy than they would for roses.Globally, there’s a growing demand for tulips, Mr. Visser said, noting that every year more tulip bulbs make their way to the United States from the Netherlands (where the bulk of the world’s tulips are grown) for holidays like Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and Easter.",New York Times

They include the island’s big trade surplus with the United States, which climbed to a record $74 billion last year according to U.S. data, and its military spending and preparations, which many in Washington see as lacking, even though billions of dollars worth of orders of American military equipment are stuck in a backlog.

Mr. Trump has long championed this principle, presenting it as a simple matter of fairness — redress to the fact that many American trading partners maintain higher tariffs.Yet in practice, calculating individual tariff rates on thousands of products drawn from more than 150 countries poses a monumental problem of execution for a vast range of companies, from American manufacturers dependent on imported parts to retailers that buy their goods from overseas.",New York Times

He filed his decision on Saturday, Dec. 7, denying Rupert’s attempt to change the trust in an opinion that was both categorical and withering. In his judgment, Rupert and Lachlan had acted in bad faith. They had not been motivated solely by the interests of the trust’s beneficiaries; rather, Gorman wrote, their newly appointed managing directors — Barr, Roberson and O’Donnell — had been enlisted into “a carefully crafted charade” to “permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s” control of the empire and to secure Rupert’s legacy by ensuring that his companies “continue to be alternative, conservative voices in media after he dies.”Gorman dismissed the alleged evidence of a sibling plot against Lachlan — including the Claridge’s meeting and the Succession Memo — as unconvincing, characterizing the discussions held by James, Liz and Prue about the future of the companies as “at most casual and inchoate.” He did, at least, seem charmed by Rupert’s disarming, if ultimately self-defeating, candor. Gorman wrote that he “showed himself at trial to be neither a victim of his infirmities nor lacking in mental vigor,” noting that he testified with “appropriate recall and, at times, sharp wit.” In the end, Gorman found him to be “the least coached (and perhaps the least coachable) and, by and large, one of the more credible witnesses to appear in this case.”He had a very different view of Lachlan. Gorman seemed especially disturbed by what he characterized as Lachlan’s misleading testimony about the recombination of the two companies, calling it “an example of Lachlan Murdoch’s lack of candor with the parties and on the witness stand.”Gorman was even more scathing when it came to the new managing directors. He concluded that Barr’s failure to disclose the Bank of America report was a sign of bad faith and that the three “did not act impartially” when they approved the changes to the trust — an act that he described as “an abuse of discretion and a breach of the fiduciary duties owed to the trust and its beneficiaries.”Rupert and Lachlan promptly moved to appeal Gorman’s decision — and Barr has also filed his own challenge to it — but it’s unlikely to be overturned. The Top Hat Amendment and Project Family Harmony are probably finished. Rupert and Lachlan, it appeared, had taken their shot and missed. If they want to lock in Lachlan’s leadership and secure Rupert’s legacy, they will need to find another way, probably by returning to the negotiating table with Prue, Liz and James. But the objecting children now hold all the leverage. As things stand, they have the power to change the editorial direction of Rupert’s companies after he’s gone.

The company gave preferential treatment to workers who did not support the union, according to the charges filed by CAUSE. Amazon also unfairly fired the co-founder of the union one week before workers filed for a union election in December, CAUSE said in a filing.Amazon denied any election interference. Employees have the choice of whether to join a union, and the company talks “openly, candidly and respectfully” about unionization, Ms. Hards said before the vote. She said the CAUSE co-founder had been fired for “repeated misconduct that included making derogatory and racist comments to his co-workers.”Addressing demands voiced by the union, Ms. Hards said the company already offered safe workplaces, competitive pay, industry-leading benefits and consistent scheduling. The CAUSE union, she added, “has no experience representing workers or their interests.”On top of what they characterized as resistance from the company, organizers at the warehouse faced an environment in the South that has historically been hostile to unions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, union membership in North Carolina last year was 2.4 percent, the lowest rate in the country and far below the national average of 9.9 percent.",New York Times

The operations generally substituted indoor LED lights for sunlight and used watering systems that spritzed plant roots — no soil needed. The farms sprouted in places as varied as downtown Newark and Dubai, on the Persian Gulf.The Guardian estimated that there were more than 2,000 vertical farms in the U.S. in 2022, raising vegetables and fruits in stacked trays or long columns, some several stories high, some tended by robots. That year, Walmart announced that it would harvest salad greens from a vertical farm in Compton, Calif., to be run by a company named Plenty.More recently, the industry has stumbled. High interest rates and energy costs have caused many operations to close or declare bankruptcy.

Altogether, the measures will hit more than $1.3 trillion of U.S. imports, and the president has said that tariffs for many other countries and industries, from copper to pharmaceuticals, are in the works.",New York Times

Do You Have a Plan for the Nickel?","The benefits of the status quo are clear: The Mint is expected to remain profitable in the near future. Taking action on the penny or any other coin, as we’ll see, comes with trade-offs.Option 2: Stop minting the pennyIf the Mint did stop minting pennies, it would save about $85 million a year. Unfortunately, it would then have bigger and more expensive problem: the nickel.“If you get rid of the penny, it will increase the amount of nickels,” Mr. Jeppson said. “And you lose more on a nickel than you do on a penny.”Last year the government lost 8.8 cents on each nickel it minted (compared with 2.7 cents per penny). Because many times more pennies are minted than nickels, losses were higher for the penny, but this isn’t always the case. In 2023, for example, the Mint made more nickels than normal and lost $93 million making them compared with $86 million in losses making the penny. The size of the orders for each coin comes from the Federal Reserve, and the orders fluctuate each year, depending on demand.It’s unclear exactly how high demand would be for nickels in a penny-less world, but it’s likely that it would be higher than today. And, given their expense, it’s possible those costs could eventually swallow up any savings gained by eliminating the penny.There are other effects to consider, too. Many states have a sales tax that specifies taxes collected must be rounded to the nearest cent, so they would probably have to modify their laws to accommodate cash purchases. Stores would need new rounding policies for purchases made in cash.But it is possible to eliminate the penny. Canada did it in 2012, and the Defense Department stopped using pennies on its bases in the 1980s when it decided it wasn’t worth the cost of shipping them.",New York Times

His administration has raised levies on China, announced reciprocal tariffs on trading partners with policies Mr. Trump deems “unfair” and threatened 25 percent charges on automobile, semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports. These measures come on the heels of 25 percent duties on steel and aluminum.The minutes from the January meeting showed that officials were wary about the potential economic impact of the tariffs, as well as policies related to mass deportations, another cornerstone of Mr. Trump’s plans. Both were cited as “having the potential to hinder the disinflation process,” according to the minutes.Fed officials more broadly saw “upside risks to the inflation outlook,” the minutes said, with some warning that “it might be especially difficult to distinguish between relatively persistent changes in inflation and more temporary changes that might be associated with the introduction of new government policies.”Whether the Fed will need to alter its plans for interest rates as a result is not yet clear.Christopher J. Waller, a governor on the board, suggested in a speech on Monday that the Fed could “look through” the potential inflationary effects posed by tariffs, given his expectation that they will be fleeting in nature. Moreover, he said, any rise in prices from these policies may be counteracted by others, which could have “positive supply effects and put downward pressure on inflation.”For the time being, Fed officials believe their current interest rate settings — at 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent — are holding back economic activity and continuing to weigh on inflation, which as of last month came in hotter than expected.",New York Times

Mr. Musk helped create OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015, along with Mr. Altman and others. In 2018, Mr. Musk left the organization after a battle for control of the company.

In 2023, crypto fraud cost American investors an estimated $4.8 billion, according to the F.B.I. The scams are so common that law-enforcement authorities have taken to calling them by a pithy name: Pig butchering, a rough translation of an expression widely used in China, where these scams have proliferated in recent years. The scammer’s victim is the pig, slowly fattened for slaughter.The scams typically begin with messages on LinkedIn, Facebook or WhatsApp from an unknown phone number or someone posing as a romantic prospect. Sometimes the conversations lead to business introductions, a connection to a banker or asset manager, with a slick headshot and a fictional résumé. The target is offered an investment opportunity, often backed up by a fraudulent website masquerading as an actual crypto business or an app that displays fake profits on fake account statements. Eventually, the scams all end the same way: The money disappears.After draining his personal savings, Hanes began stealing — from his local investment club, from his church and finally from the bank. Over a few weeks, he ordered a series of large wire transfers, telling his bewildered colleagues that he was helping a client. In May 2023, Hanes transferred $3 million from Heartland to an account at a company called Kraken, which offers trading in digital currencies. To buy more crypto, he directed Heartland to borrow about $21 million from a network of regional lenders and siphoned a similar amount using a credit line that the bank maintained with another institution. Over four weeks in June, Hanes sent $31 million of the embezzled funds to his Kraken account.Later, as his friends and colleagues sorted through the wreckage, Hanes would be called a thief, a liar and “pure evil.” But his lawyer eventually put it differently: “He was the pig that was butchered.”On July 5, 2023, not long before Heartland’s board meeting, Hanes sent a text to a farmer in Elkhart named Brian Mitchell: He needed Mitchell’s help with something. Mitchell didn’t have any role at the bank, but he was used to fielding requests from friends in town. With a diamond stud in one ear, Mitchell stood out among the other farmers.

TikTok was recently banned in the United States under a new federal law that prohibited distribution in the country if it was not sold to a non-Chinese owner, though Mr. Trump delayed enforcement of the law until early April.Mr. Trump’s assignment plunges Mr. Vance into a fraught geopolitical and corporate negotiation over the fate of the app, which counts some 170 million American users. It is not clear who could buy TikTok in the United States, or even whether China or ByteDance, TikTok’s owner, would allow a sale. And the Trump administration is under scrutiny for its decision to disregard the law’s Jan. 19 deadline for a sale or a ban.Mr. Vance’s involvement ensures that he and Mr. Trump — both of whom once supported banning TikTok because of national security concerns — have some public accountability for saving it, according to analysts and people involved in negotiations for a sale.

While Apple and Google kept TikTok out of their app stores, companies like Oracle, which provided back-end technology support for the app, resumed working with it after a brief shutdown in January.Apple and Google did not comment beyond saying they had reinstated the app. TikTok and a spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.TikTok’s return to the app stores means it is now back to operating as it always did in the United States.

H.S.A. funds can also be spent on nonmedical costs after age 65 without penalty. The money is taxed as ordinary income.The new analysis by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit group, assumes that at age 25, a saver begins contributing the maximum allowable amount each year ($4,300 for an individual in 2025 — the amount is tweaked annually for inflation — and an additional $1,000 for people 55 and older) and continues those contributions through age 64 with no withdrawals, “regardless of whether the individual uses any health care services.” It also assumes the funds are invested and earn a 7.5 percent rate of return.At lower rates of return, or fewer years of saving, the total would be less. At a 5 percent return, total savings after 40 years would be about $540,000 and at 2.5 percent, $298,000. Recent estimates of average savings needed to cover health care costs in retirement range from $165,000 to $184,000 for an individual, depending on variables like health status and the type of Medicare plan or other health coverage the person may have.The catch in saving so much in an H.S.A., of course, is the difficulty of maxing out annual contributions and leaving the money alone for four decades, paying for any needed care with other funds. Many account holders use H.S.A.s as if it were a checking account to pay for current care rather than for long-term savings. According to Devenir, an H.S.A. investment firm, 47 percent of funded H.S.A.s had withdrawals in 2023. As of mid-2024, just 9 percent of all accounts invested at least part of their balance.Paul Fronstin, director of health benefits research at the institute and an author of the analysis, said that the report illustrated the potential of H.S.A.s when someone took full advantage of them — but that not everyone could.",New York Times

Aviation experts say the investigation will probably identify multiple safety failures, as is often the case with plane crashes.The claims by Mr. Crafton’s wife, Rachel, and their three sons on Tuesday were filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which enables individuals to take the federal government to court for property damage, personal injury or death. One was filed against the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees air traffic control, and the other against the Army.

If they reject the claims or fail to respond within six months, the family can file a lawsuit in federal court.In a statement, the Army said it declined to comment on the claim against it out of respect for those who died, their families and the investigation. “Our primary focus is on supporting the families and ensuring the safety of our soldiers and the public,” it said.The F.A.A. did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Clifford said he expected to defer a decision on suing any companies connected to the crash until the N.T.S.B. issued a preliminary report.

Even such a huge sum is not nearly enough for all of their ideas, and so lawmakers must now decide which policy commitments are essential and which ones they can live without.For a sense of the Republican predicament, take a look at the 2017 tax cuts. Many of the measures in that law, including a larger standard deduction and more generous child tax credit, expire at the end of the year. The overriding goal of this year’s bill is to extend the expiring provisions, which provide their largest benefits to the rich, before they end.But accomplishing just that would cost roughly $4 trillion over the next 10 years. Then there’s a coveted business tax break for research and development — which, in an example of the zigzag of tax policy in Washington, Republicans wound down in 2017 and now want to revive. That would be another $150 billion. Allowing companies to once again deduct more of the interest on their debt is another $50 billion.",New York Times

During the campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly called on the Fed to lower rates. Yet any threat to the Fed’s ability to operate freely could panic the markets, which, clearly, is not what Mr. Trump wants.To the contrary, when the markets are strong, he frequently cites them as a barometer of his popularity. In 2017, he boasted about the performance of the stock market an average of once every 35 hours, Politico calculated.Shortly after the November election, I wrote that the markets might restrain some of Mr. Trump’s actions. But I wouldn’t go too far with this now. Few government departments or traditions seem to be off limits for the administration's aggressive changes in policy or reductions in work force, masterminded by Mr. Trump’s sidekick, the billionaire disrupter-in-chief, Elon Musk. Just look at The Times’s running tabulation of the actions taken since Jan. 21. It’s dizzying.Still, so far, at least, the administration has been remarkably circumspect when it comes to the Fed. That doesn’t mean President Trump has entirely constrained himself: He has continued to mock the Fed, saying in a social media post that it has “failed to stop the problem they created with Inflation” and has wasted its time on issues like “DEI, gender ideology, ‘green’ energy, and fake climate change.”Nonetheless, Mr. Bessent said specifically that Mr. Trump “is not calling for the Fed to lower rates.” Instead, the Treasury secretary said, “If we deregulate the economy, if we get this tax bill done, if we get energy down, then rates will take care of themselves and the dollar will take care of itself.” The president has not contradicted him.

The potential outcome is unclear, but Mary Ziegler, a law professor and abortion expert at the University of California, Davis, said there was legal precedent for extradition not being required for defendants who were not in the state where the alleged crime was committed and did not flee from that state.In the civil case, Texas is considered likely to file a petition in a state court in New York to try to collect the financial penalty. If New York were to cite its shield law to argue against the Texas penalty, as expected, the case could transform into a battle in federal court or the Supreme Court over whether the shield law is constitutional in allowing one state to refuse to cooperate with another state’s legal actions.Dr. Carpenter has not been reachable for comment about either the Texas or Louisiana case. The Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, an organization she co-founded, has issued statements in response to the cases. “Shield laws are essential in safeguarding and enabling abortion care regardless of a patient’s ZIP code or ability to pay,” the coalition has said. “They are fundamental to ensuring everyone can access reproductive health care as a human right.”",New York Times

Crash Warnings Were Years in the Making,"On a bright, clear morning in July 2018, three military helicopters traveling south along the Potomac River came seconds away from smashing into a plane that was arriving at Ronald Reagan National Airport. The air traffic controller had failed to warn the aircraft of the potential collision, and the helicopters had to maneuver abruptly to avoid a crash.The Federal Aviation Administration documented the incident in safety reports and used it as a case study in a nationwide training course for air traffic controllers on how to issue precise warnings to pilots when they are in danger.But problems with air traffic around Reagan National persisted. Controllers, pilots and military officials were so worried about busy helicopter routes near the airport that they formed safety groups in attempts to prevent a crash, four people familiar with the discussions said.And after a series of incidents, an internal report in 2019 explicitly warned that recurring controller error increased “the risk of a collision and loss of life,” according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.Despite these efforts, an Army Black Hawk helicopter slammed into American Airlines Flight 5342 two weeks ago at almost exactly the same location as the 2018 incident, killing all 67 people aboard both aircraft.The crash was the culmination of mounting warning signs at Reagan National, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former air traffic controllers, pilots and aviation safety experts, as well as federal safety reports and F.A.A. records reviewed by The Times.Federal investigators are still trying to piece together what caused the crash. The helicopter appears to have been flying higher than authorized and its pilots seem to have been dealing with other complex conditions. But even before an official determination is made, a growing body of clues suggest the midair collision was the result of a cascading series of breakdowns long in the making, including by air traffic control, whose mandate is to guide aircraft safely on the ground and through the skies.Repeated attempts to draw attention to safety lapses and potentially dangerous operating conditions at the control tower at Reagan National at times went unheeded, according to four people familiar with the matter and F.A.A. safety records reviewed by The Times.An F.A.A. spokesman declined to comment, citing the active investigation.",New York Times

Becoming Nonprofits.,"Certainly not all nonprofit theaters are doing well, but the model has worked, at least so far, in places like the Berkshires, where a devoted and well-heeled clientele is willing and able to support the arts. Two nearby nonprofit movie theaters in New York, the Moviehouse in Millerton and the Crandell Theater in Chatham, have attracted sizable fan bases. Across the country, more than 250 movie theaters are nonprofits, said Bryan Braunlich, executive director of the Cinema Foundation, a movie-industry group that provides research for cinemas.“We are definitely seeing a trend of communities rallying around their local theaters,” he said.And movie theaters have needed saving. Since 2019, the number of screens operating in the United States has declined 12 percent, to 36,369 as of 2023, said David Hancock, chief analyst in media and entertainment at the research firm Omdia. The popularity of at-home streaming over the past decade was a factor. Before the pandemic, audience numbers were already waning, but Covid nearly dealt the industry a death blow, as consumers got used to staying home and became pickier about what movies they went to a theater to see.“People certainly came back, but much more slowly,” said the Triplex’s former owner, Richard Stanley. “Ultimately, I saw the handwriting on the wall and decided I had to close.”When a theater shuts down in town, it’s not just a problem for film buffs. Because of their unique architecture, with sloped floors and few windows, they are hard to convert to other purposes and often leave prominent spaces empty.",New York Times

Mr. Musk helped found OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015, along with Mr. Altman and others.

And one of the most significant financial challenges to watch out for are the out-of-pocket costs you can face aside from monthly premiums — including deductibles and other types of cost sharing.Just how much you’ll pay, and when, depends on the type of Medicare enrollment that you choose: traditional Medicare, which is operated by the government and provides care on a fee-for-service basis, or Medicare Advantage, which is run by private insurance companies and operates on a managed care model.There is no built-in annual out-of-pocket limit in traditional Medicare for outpatient and hospitalization services. Protection is available from supplemental insurance coverage. Some retirees get this from former employers, unions or Medicaid, but most often it means purchasing Medigap — a policy offered by private insurance companies that covers part or all of Medicare’s cost-sharing requirements. And 10 percent of people on traditional Medicare age 65 or older don’t have any supplemental protection, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group — which is a risky move, experts say.Medicare Advantage plans come with out-of-pocket limits — but they can be high, ranging from roughly $5,000 to $9,000 annually depending on the services you use. What’s more, the out-of-pocket protection varies among plans. When serious medical conditions arise, out-of-pocket costs can be a significant financial hit or make it difficult to afford care altogether.

While the White House has not yet announced any details, planning for the trip may already be underway. The Chinese leadership under President Xi Jinping is unlikely to agree to a date until it is confident of a positive outcome, and an escalation of the current tariff battle could derail the meeting altogether.Americans should welcome talks between Mr. Trump and his biggest rival. We should not expect, nor should American negotiators seek, a grand bargain that tries to address numerous unrelated economic and security issues. Instead, Mr. Trump and his negotiators should attempt to make progress on a discrete set of objectives that advance American interests. Whatever the outcome, this is not a Nixon-in-China moment. The geopolitical landscape is radically different from that of the early 1970s. Americans should look beyond the bluster to what Mr. Trump could really accomplish.The timing is opportune for this kind of focused negotiation. While China is a formidable strategic competitor, it is not in a position of unquestioned strength. It faces significant economic challenges, including a volatile real estate market, mounting government debt, weak consumer spending, a rapidly aging population and a slowdown in growth. This should give Mr. Trump leverage, but not as much as some experts expect. Mr. Xi views China’s domestic problems as short-term irritants and considers the United States and the American-led world order to be in inexorable decline.Still, there are things that he will seek to bring home from the negotiating table. Mr. Xi most likely wants to avoid any more tariffs on Chinese products, prevent the United States from repealing China’s permanent normal trade relations status and persuade Mr. Trump to ease restrictions on China’s access to advanced American technology.

As deputy prime minister and finance minister, I understood the threat posed by Mr. Trump’s aggressive economic nationalism. From the moment he was elected, I argued Canada needed to prepare for an emboldened Trump 2.0 who was intent on using trade as a weapon to sow chaos and scare capital and investment from all markets other than the United States.Some Americans may feel this “might makes right” approach suits the current economic situation. The problem is that it will hurt America’s economy, too. Higher costs for supplies of steel and aluminum will hurt the very manufacturers and consumers President Trump claims to support.Canada is the largest source of aluminum for the United States, sending it 3.2 million metric tons last year. Given the intense heat required to produce it, aluminum is electricity in physical form. That means that a tariff on Canadian aluminum is a tax on energy — at a time when the United States desperately needs more power to supercharge its A.I. race with China.Canadians need to understand the cards we hold. And we have to be prepared to play them.In 2018, Canada imposed dollar-for-dollar retaliation on 16.6 billion in Canadian dollars in U.S. steel, aluminum and other imports, deliberately targeting products from red states like Florida orange juice and Wisconsin cheese.Mr. Trump may not care much about the objections of people in Canada — or Mexico or the European Union or South Korea — but he does care about American workers and businesses.

The brutal work paid little, and there were few opportunities for young men like him. The government was dominated by a northern ethnic elite that shunned his southern tribe.

The vice president’s speech last week at the Munich Security Conference — in which the man who refuses to say that Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election lectured his audience about Europe’s retreat from democratic values — combined with his meeting with the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party, has caused a scandal because it is a scandal, a monument of arrogance based on a foundation of hypocrisy.Why does the AfD dismay so many Germans, including traditional conservative voters? The party began in 2013 in protest of Germany’s fiscal policies in Europe. It gained a further boost through its opposition to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-arms policy toward the uncontrolled immigration of more than a million Middle Eastern refugees.But the party soon took a much darker turn. In 2017, Björn Höcke, a party leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, complained that Germans were “the only people in the world who’ve planted a monument of shame at the heart of their capital” — a reference to the memorial to the victims of the Holocaust — and that the country needed “nothing less than a 180-degree turnaround in the politics of remembrance.” In 2018, the party leader at the time, Alexander Gauland, dismissed “Hitler and the Nazis” as “just a speck of bird shit in over 1,000 years of successful German history.”Last year, the German investigative news site Correctiv reported that in 2023 AfD politicians had met with other far-right extremists in a hotel in Potsdam, near Berlin, to discuss an “overall concept, in the sense of a master plan” for the “remigration” of “migrants” to their countries of ethnic origin — no matter whether those migrants were asylum seekers, permanent residents or German citizens. The star of the show was a 34-year-old Austrian named Martin Sellner, who as a teenager confessed to putting swastika stickers on a synagogue before going on to lead Austria’s so-called identitarian movement.This record explains, in part, why all of Germany’s mainstream parties refuse to go into any sort of coalition government with the AfD, even as it is polling in second place in this month’s federal elections. Vance may seem to think it’s the responsibility of democracy to embrace any party or point of view; it’s worth wondering what he might have said if, instead of the AfD polling at around 20 percent, an antisemitic and anti-democratic Muslim Brotherhood-style party was drawing a similar percentage of voters.",New York Times

By now, most will know that in the past, many diamonds were mined in African war zones where rebel groups used the proceeds to fund their violent insurgencies. To assuage any guilt that may taint the romantic gesture, the diamond industry tells us that today, 99 percent of diamonds are now conflict-free.It’s true there has been progress. A generation ago, as much as 15 percent of global diamond production was believed to be linked to conflict. But in 2003, thanks to public pressure and awareness campaigns by organizations like Global Witness, a certificate system known as the Kimberley Process was born. Backed by a United Nations resolution, the system allowed for rigorous tracking that is supposed to keep so-called blood diamonds from being sold in global markets.The reality is that there’s still virtually no way of knowing whether a diamond is connected to some kind of atrocity. The system is riddled with problems: Monitoring is lax, enforcement is nearly nonexistent, and the definitions of “conflict” are so narrow that they exclude the many other forms of violence and abuse that plague the trade. Some of the system’s own architects have abandoned it. Without genuine change, consumers may decide that the only ethical stones are those that haven’t been mined at all.The price of a diamond — unlike, say, that of cobalt, another mineral linked to human rights abuses — has little to do with its utility, though diamonds do have some uses. These crystals of carbon, which form naturally in the heat and pressure of the earth’s mantle, are among the tightest configurations of atoms in the known universe. Their hardness is ideal for rock-coring drills, and their conductivity allows them to dissipate heat in electronics.

It does so despite Section 1 of the 14th Amendment, which declares, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”The central question raised by Mr. Trump’s order is what it means to be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. The answer most legal observers give is that it includes virtually anyone born on American soil, including those whom the order is meant to exclude, namely children born to parents in the country illegally or temporarily. Indeed, on Monday, the American Bar Association described the order as an attack on a “constitutionally protected” right. Federal judges in four states have enjoined the order, with one claiming that it “conflicts with the plain language of the 14th Amendment.”Not necessarily.The Supreme Court has held, in the 1898 case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, that children born here to permanent residents are citizens. But it has never squarely held that children born to those illegally present are citizens. When the court addresses that question — which it almost certainly must — it should consider the 14th Amendment’s original purpose and the common-law principle of “jus soli,” or birthright citizenship, which informed the original public meaning of the text. Both relate to the idea of social compact and contradict today’s general assumption that the common-law principle depends solely upon place of birth.The 14th Amendment’s RootsAt the time of its adoption, the publicly known purpose of the 14th Amendment was to extend the benefits of the social compact — including, specifically, the privileges and immunities of citizenship — to African Americans newly freed after the Civil War. (Due in large part to a series of egregious Supreme Court rulings gutting the original letter and spirit of the amendment, that promise of equal citizenship was largely denied for decades.)",New York Times

He has criticized past U.S. policy in Afghanistan for overreach and unrealistic goals. And he has taken bold action toward Afghanistan before. In 2020, his first administration negotiated the U.S.-Taliban agreement — later executed by President Joe Biden — that ended America’s longest war.More recently, Mr. Trump has made clear his interest in recovering the military equipment, valued at $7 billion, left behind by the United States. He has also said the huge Bagram Air Base should have been kept under U.S. control as a check on China’s power in the region. These objectives are impossible without direct contact with the Taliban.Mr. Trump is right to worry about China’s influence in Afghanistan. After the U.S. withdrawal in 2021, China kept its diplomatic mission open in Kabul and has expanded ties with the Taliban. It welcomed a Taliban ambassador to Beijing, forged relationships with Taliban security forces and Chinese companies have secured commercial contracts in industries like oil and minerals extraction. Beijing sees Afghanistan as important for its plan to increase Chinese influence in the region through economic ties. But the Taliban still see the United States as a preferred partner, and a proactive U.S. policy could help keep China’s influence in check.Purely from the terrorism standpoint, Afghanistan demands U.S. attention. The country is home to militant groups that, with the Taliban in control, now have freer rein. The Taliban have opened thousands of madrassas, religious schools where young men may be exposed to notions of jihad and potential breeding grounds for future generations of extremists. The taking of foreign hostages has resulted in prisoner swaps with the United States that have freed Taliban terrorists and drug traffickers.A particularly potent threat exists in the Islamic State Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K, the group’s regional affiliate in Afghanistan and Pakistan. ISIS-K, which is at odds with the Taliban, has been expanding external operations and recruitment, especially in Pakistan and Central Asia, and has carried out targeted assassinations in Afghanistan. The Department of Homeland Security warned in October of the growing risk of attacks outside Afghanistan from groups like ISIS-K, and various plots and threats already have come to light. Jihadist groups are just a text message away from radicalizing recruits in the West, including in diaspora communities. This means that any counterterrorism efforts directed at Afghanistan must also include more robust intelligence-gathering in the United States itself, as well as outreach to trusted diaspora leaders to help identify and disrupt threats.",New York Times

The stuff people tossed away and probably never thought about again — dirty yogurt cups, old Coke bottles — became some of the most redistributed objects on the planet, typically winding up thousands of miles away. It was a bewildering process, one that began with the export of toxic industrial waste. By the late 1980s, thousands of tons of hazardous chemicals had left the United States and Europe for the ravines of Africa, the beaches of the Caribbean and the swamps of Latin America.In return for this cascade of toxins, developing countries were offered large sums of cash or promised hospitals and schools. The result everywhere was much the same. Many countries that had broken from Western imperialism in the 1960s found that they were being turned into graveyards for Western industrialization in the 1980s, an injustice that Daniel arap Moi, then the president of Kenya, referred to as “garbage imperialism.” Outraged, dozens of developing nations banded together to end waste export. The resulting treaty — the Basel Convention, entered into force in 1992 and ratified by nearly every nation in the world but not the United States — made it illegal to export toxic waste from developed to developing countries.If only the story had ended there. Despite that legislative success, the poorer nations of the world have never stopped being receptacles for the West’s ever-proliferating rubbish. The situation now is, in many respects, worse than it was in the 1980s. Then, there was widespread recognition that waste export was immoral. Today, most waste travels under the guise of being recyclable, cloaked in the language of planetary salvation. For the past two years I’ve been traveling the globe — from the plains of Romania to the slums of Tanzania — in an attempt to understand the world trash is making. What I saw was terrifying.I started in Accra, the capital of Ghana, where millions of faltering electronics have been “donated” by Western companies and universities since the 2000s. There I met communities of “burner boys,” young migrants from the country’s desert fringes who make cents an hour torching American cellphone chargers and television remotes once they stop working. They told me about coughing up blood at night. It’s no surprise: The section of Accra they inhabit, a squalid estuary known as Agbogbloshie, regularly ranks among Earth’s most poisoned places. Anyone who eats an egg in Agbogbloshie, according to the World Health Organization, will absorb 220 times the tolerable daily intake of chlorinated dioxins, a toxic byproduct of electronic waste.",New York Times

Where Is the Outrage?,"The world is witnessing a new era of conflict. In Gaza, images of devastation have dominated headlines for more than a year. In Ukraine, nations have rallied to defend sovereignty against aggression, deploying diplomatic interventions, sending military aid and enacting sweeping sanctions with urgency. Yet the war unfolding in the Democratic Republic of Congo remains an afterthought. A bloody conflict is met with condemnations but no meaningful action. This stark contrast is not just neglect; it is selective justice.Last month Goma, the largest city in the east of Congo, fell to the M23 rebel group, backed by neighboring Rwanda, as part of the group’s decade-long campaign to control the region’s mineral-rich territory. The assault on Goma resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths in the first week alone and thousands of injuries. Today hospitals in Goma are overwhelmed, with many patients being treated in makeshift tents to handle the overflow. The blood supply is strained, the cost of food is skyrocketing, and access to water, electricity and the internet is severely limited. The U.N. uncovered that in the chaos, more than 100 female inmates at a prison were raped and then burned alive when the facility caught fire.Congo has been plagued by war for nearly three decades. Millions of people have been displaced, and rape has consistently been used as a weapon of war. Most estimates state that over six million people have died, making it the deadliest conflict since World War II. But many of us who live in Congo believe that the real number is much higher. And the world remains largely silent.I am a Congolese doctor. For 30 years, I have repaired the bodies of women brutalized by this war. Today I’m treating the grandchildren of my early patients. At Panzi Hospital and Foundation, the health center and nongovernmental organization I founded in 1999, we have treated over 83,000 survivors of sexual violence. Thousands have arrived pregnant by their attackers. Thirty percent of the sexual violence survivors we see are children. The patterns of terror are unmistakable: villages burned, families slaughtered, women violated — not as collateral damage but as a calculated weapon of war, designed to instill fear, erase communities and seize control.",New York Times

Both parties recognized the value to national security of building and strengthening alliances through international commerce. Congress transferred its power to set trade policy to the executive branch in exchange for a commitment that these policies would cause no substantial injury to their constituents.Instead of legislating tariffs line by line, Congress allowed for the president and his trade representatives to engage in negotiations over tariff levels and market access. Trade deals could be balanced with tariffs to offset economic injury caused by import surges, foreign subsidies and unfair competition.Access to these protective tariffs was available to any company or group that met congressionally mandated tests for what constitutes unfair trade practices and the resulting injuries. Crucially, these rules limit protection to those who need it and level access for all petitioners.Leaders of both parties have played a part in the gradual erosion of the old consensus that underpinned this system. No significant global trade agreement has been ratified by Congress since Bill Clinton signed the Uruguay Round Agreements Act in 1994, the legislative foundation for U.S. membership in the World Trade Organization. While both parties have avoided the capricious use of tariffs to pursue unrelated policy goals or extract other concessions from trading partners, they have been willing to ratify only a few limited commercial treaties since then.Congress and the executive branch, under both parties, have also tolerated the warping of the rules that regulate the granting of protective tariffs. Mr. Trump relies on dubious national security claims to place tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from close allies. In his first trade war with China, he used Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is meant to respond to unfair foreign trade practices that harm U.S. exports, to respond to claims of harms to American companies and workers by Chinese imports. President Joe Biden left these China tariffs in place and imposed new tariffs on additional imports under the same authority. In so doing, the United States has violated its commitment to fellow W.T.O. members.",New York Times

In the letters written home by Indian soldiers on the Western Front, the scale of devastation was conveyed through extended similes. Sowar Sohan Singh wrote home, in July 1915: “There is conflagration all round, and you must imagine it to be like a dry forest in a high wind in the hot weather, with abundance of dry grass and straw. No one can extinguish it but God himself — man can do nothing.” ⁠By the war’s end, the order of metaphor had reversed. In search of an image to describe their theory of how mid-latitude cyclones formed, a team led by the Norwegian meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes likened the narrow boundary between contending warm and cold air masses to battle fronts between contending armies. With Europe fresh from trench warfare, the Bjerknes theory of “polar fronts” proved as durable as its central analogy was memorable. The war had unleashed human powers of destruction that exceeded even an earthquake or a cyclone. It made sense, in its aftermath, for powerful atmospheric forces to be seen to resemble human armies.This was only a prelude to what was to come. The German and Japanese quests for domination in World War II destroyed the homes and lands that had sustained their victims. Fires burned across the frozen waste of Stalingrad, leaving what one German officer described as “an enormous cloud of burning, blinding smoke.” Fires fed the crematories of Auschwitz-Birkenau, where a million or more Jews were killed, among the six million murdered in the Holocaust. For the writer Primo Levi, who survived Auschwitz, the faint hope of human freedom amid such inhumanity lay in the natural world. “Today, in this place, our only purpose is to reach the spring,” he wrote, describing a day in the camps, when “the sun rose bright and clear for the first time from the horizon of mud.”In the last phase of World War II, even before atomic bombs defined the final threshold of ruin, the counterattack of Allied forces wielded sufficient force to make a new and unnatural weather phenomenon: the tornado-like firestorm, ignited by incendiary bombs dropped en masse on cities. More than 100,000 people were killed in the firebombings of Dresden, Hamburg and Tokyo.Scientists have estimated that wartime fires emitted more than half a billion kilograms of soot into the atmosphere in 1944 and 1945 — enough, in theory, to reduce the solar radiation reaching Earth’s surface, though it has not been possible to demonstrate any clear impact on the global climate. Even so, that such colossal impact is even plausible marks the dawn of a planetary power beyond comprehension.",New York Times

Unfortunately, mirroring China’s engagement in Africa, its construction projects in Latin America also frequently disregard local labor rights and environmental standards.In barely a month, Mr. Trump has managed not only to embitter some of our closest historical allies but also to push open the door even wider for Beijing. His proposed 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, now delayed, will not only harm consumers across North America but also create an opportunity for China to present itself as the more reliable economic partner in the region. The administration’s slash-and-burn approach to foreign aid — which in 2023 amounted to over $2 billion from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department alone in Latin America and the Caribbean — will not only signal to our neighbors that the United States can’t be trusted; it will also put our national security at risk. In Central America, U.S. aid dollars have been helping curb irregular migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador and combat transnational gangs like MS-13 that direct criminal activities in the United States and Latin America.A singular focus on deportations is at the core of the Trump administration’s “Americas first” approach. Sending migrants back to Latin American countries overshadows all other issues on the U.S. agenda in the region up to this point, as Mr. Trump’s threats of tariffs and visa bans to Colombia made clear. These threats have yielded what some view as public relations wins, such as the use of U.S. military planes to send migrants back to their home countries. These images may make for eye-catching social media posts, but President Joe Biden’s deportation flights produced the same results — using the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement aircraft that were designed for such missions.In the short term, the Trump administration will claim some wins because many governments in the region may, like Colombia, seek to accommodate Mr. Trump’s ever-mounting migration demands to avoid retribution. But in the long term, the administration’s bullying will almost certainly backfire, sending longtime allies looking to shore up relationships with other governments.American foreign aid — even when it was flowing — has always fallen far short of what is needed both in quantity and speed. Cumulative financing in Latin America from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, which was established by Congress during Mr. Trump’s first term and invests in private sector projects in developing countries, lags behind that provided by the Chinese Development Bank and Chinese companies. While reports of increased funding to the Development Finance Corporation from the Trump administration could be positive, such funding must not come at the expense of the critical U.S.A.I.D. dollars that advance our interests in the Americas. Instead of freezing aid and imposing more tariffs, the Trump administration and Congress should expand American investments in and assistance to the region. Both would ultimately strengthen our national security.",New York Times

But China’s dominance in manufacturing and exports cannot be overstated.Take automobiles, the anchor of so many industrialized countries’ manufacturing sectors for the past century. Around 20 years ago, China was a nonfactor in automaking. By 2018, it had the capacity to produce 40 million gasoline-powered cars per year, far more than the 25 million its economy needed. Since then, it has added, thanks in part to substantial government subsidies for the industry, the capacity to make 20 million electric vehicles annually, a number that may soon rise to 30 million. Annual global automotive demand is 90 million cars; China has the capacity to produce around two-thirds of that.This pattern is replicated in sector after sector. China routinely produces more than half of the global supply of steel, more than half of the world’s aluminum and more than half of the world’s ships. In clean technology sectors such as solar cells and batteries, China can produce many multiples of current global demand, and there are fears that it could replicate these successes in memory and automotive chips. What’s more, China has partly made up for the fall in domestic steel demand (caused by the housing implosion) by subsidizing the building and equipping of new factories that use domestic steel in churning out yet more manufactured exports for overseas markets.All told, Chinese export volume is growing three times as fast as global trade. This means China’s success is directly coming at the expense of manufacturers in other countries, which increasingly cannot compete and face pressure to abandon sectors that China targets. With China’s real estate market still in the doldrums, the pattern shows no signs of changing. This points to a world economy in which China has no need for the industrial inputs of other countries while leaving those countries dependent on Chinese-made goods — and vulnerable to Beijing’s political and economic pressure.",New York Times

Trump’s Actions Look Familiar. - The New York Times,"Democracy is not an on-off switch but a dial. We won’t become North Korea, but we could look more like Viktor Orban’s Hungary. This is a question not of ideology but of power grabs: Leftists eroded democracy in Venezuela and Nicaragua, and rightists did so in Hungary, India and (for a time) the Philippines and Poland. The U.S. is the next test case.When authoritarians covet power, they pursue several common strategies.First, they go after checks and balances within the government, usually by running roughshod over other arms of government. China, for example, has a Supreme Court and a National People’s Congress — but they are supine. Here in the United States, many Republican members of Congress have similarly been reduced to adoring cheerleaders.Trump ignores laws he finds inconvenient. He cannot legally fire inspectors general without 30 days’ notice, but he did so anyway. He moved to eliminate independent congressionally established agencies, which he has no authority to do. Probably unlawfully, he is sidelining Congress’s constitutional role by impounding funds. Even when faced with court orders, he appears not to be fully obeying in some cases.American judges have shown that they are made of sterner stuff than China’s, but is the Supreme Court? We’ll find out.Second, authoritarians try to crush independent referees and civil society institutions, including news organizations, universities, statistical agencies and central banks. After I covered the Tiananmen Square massacre as an eyewitness in 1989, The People’s Daily declared that I “spread new lies,” and the prime minister’s office ordered an audit of my taxes and tried to bar my infant son from getting a residence permit.
